Current links for the Blades of Exile Scenario Archives that were used to make this file :

The Archive (by Kelandon) : https://spiderwebstuff.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/archive/index.html and https://spiderwebstuff.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/archive/archive.html and https://spiderwebstuff.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/archive/other.html

I would highly recommend checking out the links above, as they will provide useful information.

TrueSite (current webmaster : Celtic Minstrel, former webmaster : Jewels) : http://truesite.openboe.com/

OpenBoE Scenario Archive : https://openboe.com/scenarios/

This file is mostly a backup of Kelandon's Archive (commonly known as "The Archive"), with a few additions from TrueSite. Also, the latest version of Shadow of the Stranger by Drizzt was uploaded from my own personal archive.

A few notes :

-There are duplicate files. Scenarios that are part of a series can be found inside both the "Normal" and "Series" folders. Utility scenarios can be found inside both the "Normal" and "Utility" folders. Scenarios that are known under several names have a separate folder for each name.

-In Kelandon's original list, the download links for The Draining and Dranhelm were reversed. I have fixed this.

-Tatterdemalion, A Little Girl and Witch or Worse seemed to be unavailable from The Archive. The ZIP files for these scenarios are from TrueSite.

-The "LOST!", "included with BoE" and "Undoomvahgaz Armor" folders were included purely for the sake of completion, as they are empty. I saw no need to include the scenarios that come with Blades of Exile, I do not have any copies of the "LOST!" scenarios, and I do not have permission to host Undoomvahgaz Armor by Zaloopa (and I don't have a copy of it anyway).

-Two versions of Shadow of the Stranger are available inside this archive. Version 1.3.0 is the latest one.

Because this is a Blades of Exile archive, you will not find a single Blades of Avernum scenario here, even if it is part of a series that began with Blades of Exile. So, for example, A Perfect Forest by Stareye is not included here. The same applies for Echoes : Renegade by Terror's Martyr.

I would like to thank the scenario designers, Kelandon, Jewels, and Celtic Minstrel for their hard work.

If you have later versions of the scenarios included in this archive and would like me to update some files, or you would like to report a mistake, or if you are a scenario designer and would like me to remove a scenario from this archive, please send a PM to The Lurker on the Spiderweb Software message boards (https://spiderwebforums.ipbhost.com/profile/4364-the-lurker/) or make a post inside this topic : https://spiderwebforums.ipbhost.com/topic/33604-scenario-archive-super-editor-and-boe-on-linux/

Last but not least, enjoy.

UPDATE (04/01/2025) : Added quite a few scenarios, including Mistb0rn's scenario package (4 scenarios), "100 Evil Sliths", "The Dark Side of the Moon", "Dependency" (Utility scenario), "The Edge of Eternity", "Nephil Cave", "Pilgrimage to Thrakos", "Resistance" (Demo), "Terror from the Park", "The Crusaders", "War Preparations", and "Zero Point *". The Portal is now properly listed as a Utility scenario. Newer versions of "On A Ship To Algiers", "Redemption", "Falling Stars", and "Northern Kingdom 0 : Prologue" have also been added. A download link to Undoomvahgaz Armor has been added inside the folder for this scenario, since it's available on openboe.com

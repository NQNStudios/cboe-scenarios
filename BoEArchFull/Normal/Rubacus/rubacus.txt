RUBACUS
A Blades of Exile Scenario
Designed by Leon Lin
(C) 1998

INTRODUCTION
------------
The big buzz about Sharabo Province is that there's lots of adventure to be had there.
And they also say there's plenty of sun, lots of good drink, and other amenities
commonly missing from dank, dark caves.

Of course, Sharabo Province isn't exactly the paradise you heard it was -- not with
its large swamps, roving bandits, and oppressive government. Still, there might be
something interesting for you to do here, and maybe, just maybe, something going
on behind everyone's back that's bigger than you imagine...

HOW TO PLAY
-----------
"Rubacus" requires a registered copy of Blades of Exile for Mac or Windows to play.

The zip file that the scenario came in should contain the following files:

rubacus.exs (scenario file)
rubacus.meg (Mac graphics file)
rubacus.bmp (Windows graphics file)
rubacus.txt (readme file)
rtrain.exs  (scenario trainer)

Mac users:
Place rubacus.exs and rubacus.meg in the "Blades of Exile Scenario" folder. If you
wish to use the trainer, place rtrain.exs in the same folder.

Windows users:
Place rubacus.exs and rubacus.bmp in the BLADSCEN directory. If you wish to use the
trainer, place rtrain.exs in the same folder.

If you have any difficulty with any of the files, please contact me at 
leonlin@ix.netcom.com.

DIFFICULTY
----------
This scenario is aimed at medium level parties (levels 9-18). One that has finished
the scenario "Valley of Dying Things" should do. If you don't already have a party
that fits the bill, use the trainer on a totally fresh party; see the section 
"THE TRAINER" below for more details. Parties of other experience levels will likely 
find the scenario either too easy or too difficult to complete.

THE TRAINER
-----------
In case you don't have a medium level party ready to go, a trainer (rtrain.exs) is 
included with this scenario. Create a totally new party and then run it through the 
trainer once. This should raise each party member to about level 11 or 12, depending 
on race and advantages/disadvantages. 13,000 gold is also provided to train the 
characters and purchase equipment. Instructions are provided in the trainer.

In general, a party created with this trainer will not be as well equipped as a
similar level party which has actually gone through another scenario, mainly because
they will not have many magic items normally gained in the course of adventuring. 
Nevertheless, parties created by the trainer should be adequate for the task at hand.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
---------------
I can't thank my beta-testers enough for their help. Without them, numerous bugs
would have gone unnoticed and unfixed. They also made many suggestions to improve the 
scenario. Thanks to Jamie "Skyle" Clark (at jamclark@kfalls.net), Ivan Godard, 
Brian "Stareye" Kiedrowski, Peter Twieg, Andy (at griffinp@ma.ultranet.com), 
Andrew Barton, and Elizabeth (at MAOSC@aol.com) for their efforts.

The machine graphics were cut and pasted out of the regular Blades of Exile graphics
set. Since I can't draw to save my life, I readapted one of the terrain graphics for
use as a monster graphic. Thanks to Andrew Hunter for this and the other graphics
in Blades of Exile -- I hope you don't mind me using the machine graphic in an
unorthodox way!

Thanks to Tarl Kudrick for his High Level Party Maker, which was adapted as the
trainer for this scenario.

And, of course, thanks to Jeff Vogel, for creating the incredible world of Exile and
the wonderful Blades of Exile scenario editor. This scenario wouldn't have been 
possible without you.

VERSION HISTORY
---------------
v. 0.9.0 - 10/4/98
==================
Initial beta

v. 0.9.1 - 10/17/98 	
===================
Second beta. Numerous bug fixes and adjustments.

v. 1.0.0 - 10/29/98
===================
First release 

v. 1.0.1 - 12/21/98
===================
Some players experienced a bug in the Tower of Nado in which the glass bead did not 
move at all on the conveyor belt. This appeared to occur after restoring a saved game. 
Leaving the level and returning fixes this problem. Unfortunately, in 1.0.0, leaving 
the conveyor belt puzzle was impossible. A teleport has been placed in the puzzle to 
allow escape before the puzzle is solved.
						
Also, a set of coordinates in the graffiti was incorrect. It did not affect the 
puzzle's solution, but has been corrected for accuracy.

Thanks for downloading Yada Yada Yada, Part II!  This is a short,
utility scenario by Alcritas (boelyceum@hotmail.com).  All of the 
graphics contained in this scenario are by Alcritas, and may be used
freely, except the stairway graphics, which are by Drizzt.

If you are on a Mac, you'll need to convert the graphics file into
a .meg file.  Good luck with that.

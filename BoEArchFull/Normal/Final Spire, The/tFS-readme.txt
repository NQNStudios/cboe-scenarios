THE FINAL SPIRE by Bain-Ihrno

Difficulty Rating: Very High 
Content Rating: PG

This scenario is intended for experienced
BoE players. It is not for people who are still
learning how to play BoE.

Anyway...

  Thank you for downloading "The Final Spire"! Before I
get to the plot, there's something you should know:

This scenario is a sequel to a scenario that does not
exist. That doesn't make sense, you say? Well, I was
making the scenario that came before it, called "Spires
of Energy." I was very close to completing it when it
crashed and the .exs file was destroyed. I was so
immersed in the story at that point that I wanted to
finish it, so here you are. This comes after the planned
end of SoE.

THE PLOT: 
The Sorcerer Order (or Sorcerers): 

They are the government of Utmir. They are an organized
dictatorship, with leaders and rankings. However, any
member of this organization is superior to a non-member.
They are made up of almost all the spellcasters and some
select bladesmen. With this power, they rule the land
with absolute tyranny....

...and now you're lost, confused, and feeling hopeless.
While resting, you have flashbacks as to what led up to
the confusion.

This is the story of Ulrike.

TECHNICAL NOTES: You will get some special spells
later in the scenario, so some of these notes are
related on how to use them.

1. RUBIES, EMERALDS, SAPPHIRES, DIAMONDS, and CRYSTALS
are needed to use the special spells. If a monster drops
one of these, PICK IT UP. There's little else monsters 
will drop in this scenario.

2. The spells are wild magic, you can't use them just 
anywhere.

3. When casting a special spell, be ABSOLUTELY SURE
you can cast it. You can still lose reagents even
if the spell is not cast!

4. Gold is not that valuable in this scenario - there
are only two shopping towns in the whole scenario, and
they come quite early in the game.

5. This scenario is a linear run-through, like An Apology
or Echoes: Assault.

6. There are additional spells you can learn in this
scenario, but there aren't that many.

7. Once you're in the castle, search everywhere! There's
important clues on bookshelves!

8. Talk to EVERYONE you meet, especially in the beginning. 
Most people have important clues! Unique terrain spots
(to the rest of the terrain) can also give a clue.

9. Chests have to be unlocked before they can be opened. Unlock
them the same way you would a door.

NOTE: There is a bug in this scenario. After the animation
scene (name removed to prevent spoilers), six PC's will
be alive. You will just have to delete the other five.
There isn't anything I can do about it.

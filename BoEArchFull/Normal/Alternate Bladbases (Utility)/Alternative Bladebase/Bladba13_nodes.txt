The scenario nodes in Bladba13.exs
Update v 1.3

Sounds
  A Scenario event timer, every 100 moves, calls sequence 130.  This is meant to be an ending sequence for any 100 move 
calling scenario timer.
SDF 291,0 is the environment flag:
  = 1 for surface (chirps)
  = 2 for caverns (drips)
  = 3 for ??? (to be created)

The node to set SDF 291,0 is called when leaving town - an Exit Town Special(s) in the Advanced Town Details pop-up 
window (under the Town menu).  For Warrior's Grove, town node 98 is called to set SDF 291,0.

20% of the time an outdoors sound will be played (either surface or cavern, based on SDF 291,0)

Special AP Spells - adapted from Stareye's list in The Dervish Challenge.  The following 13 spells have the feature of using SDF 290,X to set its severity.  Thus a stronger caster (or magical source) could use a stronger version of the spell.

Severity SDF (290,X) is initially 1 and is controlled by the 3 runes (nodes 44-46)

On a point where the spell caster can see the party
  (in this case, on a space such that the party can open the locked door at 39,42):
50  SDF? 150,0, >=1A= 2 then 51, else -1

It seems the BOE engine doesn't like Start General Timers (SGT) of 1 round duration (or nested timers).  With SGT of 1 there seems to be a 'build-up' of the two above spells until they inflict damage on the party almost every other round.  You can do some experimenting, like SGT of 2 for node 52 and a 10% chance for node 53.

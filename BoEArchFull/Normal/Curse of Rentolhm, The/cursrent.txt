Rentolhm was a grand city with many smaller towns built up around it.  The vally Rentolhm was situated in was fertile and peaceful.  Everything was perfect.Then came the curse.  First it came to the villiage of Kran.  The citizens and soldiers became zombies serving some unknown force.  Fighting broke out between villages that had once been friends.  The curse spread all through the valley.As soon as news of the curse reached King Tremais, he became fatally ill.  His young son Bobjek stood by his bed as he died.

Rawsan, the only entrance point to Rentolhm Province.Your job is to find what is causing the curse and stop it.  You should find Captain Alinia first and talk to her.  Good Luck.

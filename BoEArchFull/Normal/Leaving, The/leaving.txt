The Leaving - version 2.0.1

The Leaving is designed for a medium-level party (Level 8-15). It is set to "High" level for technical reasons, otherwise the monsters might double their hit points.

I recommend playing the game with a six-member party.

The scenario was designed and tested by Milu and "SP".

Please send comments, questions, bug reports and opinions about the game to milu@arcticmail.com. Though it may take a few days for me to answer, I'm interested in all feedback.

The original version (1.0.0) of this Blades of Exile scenario took part in a competition over half a year ago. I planned to release this version much sooner. However, better late than never...

The scenario has no custom graphics.

The language might look strange at times (in spite of the positive feedback I've got...) If it does, it's because my native language is Finnish.

Okay a few known bugs right of the bat.
 These are ones that I know about but I can't or have chosen not to fix.
Two are in the Slime Caverns.
 Do NOT go into combat mode when you are in the cells.
 There is a teleport set to a timer which won't work if you are in combat mode
 and you'll be stuck there forever.
The second is about Lifesaver Amulets.
 Normally these things have only one charge
 but it's possible to go into the scenario editor and beef them up to have more.
 Please don't do this as it will also mess up the Slime Caverns level.
Thirdly, it is impossible to win with a one character party.
 Don't try it. You will get stuck well into the adventure in a barrel moving puzzle.
 I don't think its possible to get through with a two character party either,
 for the same reason but I haven't tested extensively.
 I'd say three is the minimum number your party should be.
Also with the barrel pushing puzzle.
 BoE sometimes doesn't let you push a barrel onto a space for no discernable reason whatsoever.
 I can understand it with special nodes.
 This is why the barrel was no use in one of the side quests in 'Destiny of the Spheres',
 but sometimes it's just a plain old mystery.
 It appears to have something to do with where monsters are when you kill them.
 For this reason, make sure you kill off the final group of Upside Down Men in the room
 with the portcullis LAST.
 This wil reset early weird bit and all the barrels should move smoothly.
I've been alpha testing the scenario with a party in their low thirties levelwise.
 however, I've been heavily relying on the old Stealth/Mass Sanctuary/Major Haste combination
 to avoid many of the combats to scrape through rather than face everything head on.
 It also doesn't hurt to rest a lot.
 The only wandering monsters are in the one outdoor section.
 If you prefer more confrontative action you may want to go a little higher
 and for this reason I've rated it for very high parties.
 The downside of this is that the monsters that you actually DO have to defeat
 are a little easier than some of the ones you DON'T.
 If you think the imbalance is too severe, please email me.

The adventure is no "Monty Haul".
 Monsters will drop a fair bit of treasure but there are no hidden caches
 and only one unique item.
 You will need to go into the adventure with a fair bit of gold
 to cover expenses you may incur and don't expect to leave with more than you went in with.
I haven't included all the credits for the artwork for this beta release.
 Please forgive me. I'm extremely slack.
 However, I'll ask for everyone's permission and give credit where credit is due
 by the time of the proper release for sure.
Please contact me with any known bugs. version 1.0.0 MUST be released by December 12
 because I'm heading overseas for my new job then
 and won't be able to do any work on the project.

Enjoy!!

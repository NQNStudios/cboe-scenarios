Emulations v1.0By: Brian Kiedrowski (Stareye)bckiedrowski@wisc.edu"Ghosts within the machine."*********************************************************************************Welcome to Emulatons, my fourth scenario for Blades of Exile.  First allow me to thank you for downloading this scenario.  May you find it very enjoyable. Here are a few notes that are required reading:1) Please play with the 1 PC party given.  The scenario is balanced to work with this party.  I make no claim that the scenario is possible to complete without using the supplied PC.  Instructions are given below.2) Please ensure the custom graphics file is working properly.  If you see a pair of sandals on the carpet in front of you, they are working properly.  You will need a .BMP for Windows and a .MEG file for Mac.  If you need help making these, consult the instructions in the manual or post a help message at Spiderweb's message board.3) Be careful when you drop items, many of them are useful later on, e.g. the crystals.4) Emulations takes place in the same universe as my last two scenarios, At the Gallows and Spears.  It is not necessary that you have played them, but it will add to your playing experience.  Note that Spy's Quest, a previous effort of mine, is NOT connected to this plotline.5) Further updates and information may be found at:http://stareye08.tripod.com/emulate.html*********************************************************************************PC INSTRUCTIONSThis scenario is meant to be played by a 1 PC party.  He is very simple to create, so it should not take too long.Name: DrykonGraphic: Green Mage with Wooden StaffHP - 12SP - 30Str - 2Dex - 2Int - 4Mag - 2*********************************************************************************BACKGROUND1478 IE -- Since before Imperial history the Aizo Magicore Institute has been one of the primary places of magical learning in the world. Since you were found as an adept as a young child, it has been your dream to come here.Ten years later, your dream would come true. In the past two months of training, you have learned much information under the foremost instructors of the world. You have also come to meet several new friends here.Your two best friends here are Bale and Aavian. Bale is a neophyte like yourself, but struggling with his magical education. Both of you have been studying very hard for the upcoming round of exams.Aavian is two years older than you and she is one of this institute's greatest young magical talents. Aavian has been involved with some special research project and you have not seen her much in the past couple weeks.The three of you met as residents of Etcheverry Hall, a residence for the apprentices. It is now an early weekend morning. You are awakened by a knock on the door.*********************************************************************************CREDITSBeta Testers -- Terrors Martyr, Zharrad, Runemaster, Lt.

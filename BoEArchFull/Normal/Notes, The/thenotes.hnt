								This is the hint file for my first scenario. I was hoping you would not have to use it because this scenario is so straight forward. Anyway, here are the hints according to the towns.								1. Phelper: This is the village you start in. Not much here. I recommend you go out of this town via the boats on the western docks. You can get healing here from Mother Hailey.								2. Black Watch Tower: This is the entrance to the Reeds Black Watch. Nothing here.								3. Reeds Black Watch: This is where the plot starts. Talk to Agent Haxhelm here. He will get you started. You can also get some good things here that will aid you in your quest. They include: potions, alchemy ingredients and potion recipes from Kicks and training from Whizzo. There are some free stuff for you in the storeroom.								4. Murik: This is the major town in this scenario. The plot really develops here with the death of Agent Gavier and the theft of his notes. (These are the notes you have to recover to win the scenario.) Talk to Mayor Kurt, Commander Leahy and The Guard (two of them) for more information. Mayor Kurt has a side mission for you too (worth 350 in coins). You can buy fish and healing here too.								5. Sea Caves: This is where you meet your first pirates and fight for the first time. You will find out where your notes are going by killing a pirate. Mayor Kurt's side mission can be completed here by killing the Sea Slime that the pirates are hiding.								6. Pirate Fort: This is where that pirate took your notes. You find out where the notes have been taken to for safekeeping. There are more challenging pirates to fight and some treasure to find. This town is on the Murik Peninsula to the southeast.								7. Voinah: This is a Vahnatai village on Amalos Island. They have some services for you. You can purchase waveblades from Krai-Humrai, Vahnatai spells, wands, scrolls, energy crystals, an interesting story and identification from Khumalin Luhok, and a mission involving Goblins from Commander Lauris Vhon. The mission is worth 100 gold, 25 food and a nice waveblade.								8. Goblin Hideout: This is where you kill the Goblins. This place is hidden until Commander Lauris-Vhon in Voinah tells you where it is. There is also a West Empire Spybase hidden in the wall here. It can be accessed by a secret passage between the two Goblin arrowhouses or a secret door and passage in the Goblin Chief's residence. In this hideout you find out the location of the Pirate Headquarters and what it looks like.								9. Destroyed Village: This used to be a Vahnatai fishing village. The pirates captured it and they reside here. No difficult battles. You can find out the exact location of the West Empire Spybase in the Goblin Hideout here.								10. Pirate City Entrance: This is where you enter the Pirate Headquarters. A nasty special here that is supposed to annoy and hurt you. Some fighting.								11. Pirate City: This is the nerve centre of the pirates. Some tough battles and some nice treasure. You are getting very close to finding the notes when you get this far.								12. The Docks: This is where the stairs in the Pirate City Entrance take you. You get taken prisoner here and are forced into one of the hardest fights in the scenario. There is no way to avoid this place and its consequences. You can access Pirate City from here.								13. West Empire Spyfort: This is the last city and is where the notes can be found. There is a tough battle here. The notes are guarded by basilisks. You can avoid the basilisks through a special item in Jamison's dresser.

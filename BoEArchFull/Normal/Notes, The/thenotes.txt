								This is my first scenario. It is called "The Notes." It is for beginner level parties. It is also for beginner level thinkers because it has no difficult puzzles for you to solve. This scenario is pretty short too. It has got 13 towns, 2 medium ones and 11 small ones. It has only got what outdoor section. Conservatively, I would say it might take you 6 hours of solid playing to finish it.								This scenario is part of a bigger plot, involving several closely linked scenarios. The whole plot will be uncovered and continued as you play the various scenarios. All of the scenarios that are part of this plot are part of my first scenario collection called "The Empire Returns: Revenge of The Black Watch." I recommend you play my scenario's in order or you will get hopelessly confused. "The Notes" is based in subterrian Exile about 1000 years after the First Great War with the Empire (in the original Exile series). Peace has reigned between Exile and the Empire for the greater part of these 1000 years (with the exception of the Second Great War with the Empire), but the things you are going to discover will change that. The rest of the plot of "The Notes" should become relatively clear early on in the scenario. You won't get a firm grasp of the main plot of the collection until scenario two or three. 							 There are several key things that are essential to the plot of "The Notes". You will become familiar with them. Here are their histories.								1. The Black Watch: This is the Secret Service of Exile. It was founded while Exile was being invaded by the Empire. Its purpose is to protect Exile's sovereignty (independence). Your party (in all of my scenarios) is a part of the Black Watch. It was not used in the Exile series by Spiderweb Software. It is my idea.								2. The West Empire: Recently the Empire has broken up into the East and West Empires. They are one of your enemies.								3. The Pirates: These are your basic no good for nothing bad guys that have roamed the lake in this scenario for a long time. They do what pirates like to do. Have fun killing them.								4. The Goblins: I forgot to mention these folks. They are in most beginner level scenarios, this one is not an exception.								The Notes folder that you get will have three files in it. They are: thenotes.exs which is the game file, thenotes.txt which you are reading right now and thenotes.hnt which is the hint file.								If you have any questions, puzzles you cannot solve or bugs that you find e-mail me at marcusw@istar.ca. By the way my e-mail may change by the fall of 2003. I will keep you posted. Good luck and I hope you like "The Notes."											                  Aaron Waddington (Doodles)

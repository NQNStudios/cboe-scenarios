"A Band of Wanderers" is a small level 1 sceanrio with only two outdoor areas and 
7 towns. It is intended for begining parties. I tested with the 
default party. Feel free to play with any level one parties 
you have. Singletons should be no problem (although I did not test 
with one). There are no mage level checks.


I know that there is cave floor visible at the edge of some towns. When I first drew 
them I did not quit eunderstand how town boarders worked. I just do not have the 
time or inclination to redraw a number of towns. I am sorry about that, but please
do not email me about it.

Please email me at eseme_r@yahoo.com with any otehr comments you have. If 
they reach me bofore April 20 2002, I will be able to mention player 
responses in the honors paper I am writing concerning this project.

Thanks again!

Eseme

P.S.- the full text dump was worth the hour it took to spell check!

Beta testers:

A big thank you to everyone who beta tested my scenario and sent me 
comments. Thanks to Sarachim, iambobsushi, Terror's Martyr, and Xex.

Special thanks goes to The Creator, who sent me PAGES of detailed and 
nit-picky comments which were very helpful. Not to mention playing it again later
to look at the changes I made. Wow, thanks for the warm welcome to the design community!

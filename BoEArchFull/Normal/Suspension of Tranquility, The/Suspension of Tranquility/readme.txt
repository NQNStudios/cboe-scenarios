Suspension Of Tranqulity" Information

	I. Requirements 
		To run this scenario, you will need the registered vesion of Blades of Exile, since it is a custom scenario,
		developed Eric Jensen, and me(Sean Rea). Just pop it into the scenario folder, run Blades, and choose it from 
		the custom scenario menu.
	
	II. Description
		 While taking a brief break from adventuring, you recieve word of a vessel which has landed, unmanned, near 
		 Klaun. Obviously, you accept the offer and find a strange item cult, which is the cult you dealt with in
		 Exile 3. 
		 
	III. Hints
		  
		  1.) Why can't I cross the mountains? You probably need some skis. Ask around in Klaun.
		  2.) Why can't I get into the thief hideout? You'll need a ID pin. Find the Dungeon Of Adalome.
		 
		 These would be the 2 main problems you might have. There are others, but I'm not helping you discover the
		 answers to them. You can, however, always email me.

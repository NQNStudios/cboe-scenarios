This scenario is rated for Very High parties only to avoid problems resulting from monster HP doubling.  (A rather annoying feature.) Since my experience indicates that you can expect to gain 30+ levels in this scenario, this is a neccessary measure.

I'm not entirely certain what level would be appropriate.  I beat this scenario starting with a level 1 party, if that helps.  (OTOH, some beta testers complained about difficulty.)

The story is fairly simple.  A powerful magi has pulled you out of your world (Exile/Empire), and wants you to help him with a dangerous battle.  Of course, first you need to prepare for this battle.  Oh, yes, and you need to find the archmage.

Also, this is a two part scenario.  Consequently, some things may not make much sense at first.  (I think I've eliminated most of these things, but there may still be a few oddities.)

You may notice that there are many wandering encounters.  There are also small huts scattered around.  You might think that this does not make sense, however, in all such cases, one of two things is true.  Either the occupant(s) of said hut are powerful enough to defend themselves, or insignificant enough that the wandering monsters ignore them.  (Keep in mind, almost all of those encounters are with members of the Dark Tower's armies, or creatures controlled from there.  They are not mindlessly rampaging.)

Finally, many hostile dungeons may not make sense at first.  Keep these things in mind, and they will.

1. All the Dark Lords are very paranoid.  (After all, the least trusting people are usually those least worthy of trust.)

2. You will almost never be fighting through an entire dungeon.  In most cases, you will only be entering those portions specifically designed to trap adventurers that try attacking.

3. These sections will rarely be entered by any of your enemies (Except to attack you, or to maintain the various traps.)  In general, there will be a bypass (that you can't reach) or the master of the dungeon will be powerful enough to produce portals at will, eliminating the need for such things as doors.  (Or sometimes both will be true.)

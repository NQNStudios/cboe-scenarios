Welcome to Two Strands.  This is a very short scenario, designed for level one parties.  (It will read "very high", but this is to avoid monster HP doubling.)  A quick note- this scenario has no password.  This means that you can open it up in the editor.  If you are absolutely stuck and need to know what to do next (or you just want to fiddle around with what I created), feel free.  If you're still stuck after looking in the editor, email me, and I'll be happy to help you through this scenario.

This scenario comes with a few files included.  They are:

* divine.exs
This is the scenario file itself.  Place it in your scenarios folder.
* divine.bmp
This is the scenario graphics file.  If you use Windows, place it in your scenario folder.
* divine.meg.sit
This is the scenario graphics file.  If you use Mac, open it, and if you have UnStuff, another file will appear (divine.meg).  Place that file in your scenario folder.
* divinepc.gif
This is the backup scenario graphics file for PC users.  If divine.bmp does not work, then use a simple graphics editing program (Paint will suffice) to convert this file into a .bmp, and place it in your scenario folder.
*divinemac.gif
This is the backup scenario graphics file for Mac users.  If you are on a Mac and divine.meg does not work, then copy this image, and paste it into a ResEdit file.  Call the ResEdit file divine.meg, and place it into your scenario folder.
* divine.txt
This is the readme file you are reading right now.

Special notice should be given to Alec Kyras, who while disowning this project half way into it, still provided a good amount of base inspiration.

Also, special thanks to Bruce Mitchell and Mervian, who gave me functioning BMP files.  (My computer, for some inexplicable reason, cannot make BMP files that work on both platforms.)

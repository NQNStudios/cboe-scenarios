The Green and Good Tavern 

          A scenario by Kattana'ver Reaper(Dylan Hadd)

This scenario is for begginer level parties and is balenced specificly for the "cats" party enclosed with the scenario. depending on how many goblins you wan't to kill this level should take between 2 and 48 hours to complete and should raise you party to between level 3 and 15. Also the "cats" party has been edited, i have given the items and spells, removed some spells and given them extra experience. If you feel like playing the scenario with a higher level party it should still prove enjoyable and challenging.

Ps; For added fun don't forget to use summoning spells(summon host, weak summoning, ect...)

********************************The Magic Flute 1.0.0by Stephen Masel ©1999 (just)Contact: stephen_masel@hotmail.comhttp://homes.arealcity.com/Measle/index.html********************************Here it is. It's based on an opera. It's rated 'G' which is a nice change for me. I really struggled not to have any humnas killed. You already know how to install it.It's early in the morning of 31/12/99 so I'm having a late one tonight so I'd better go sleepy byes now.XOXO Measle

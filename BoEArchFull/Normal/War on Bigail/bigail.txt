War on Bigail	This scenario is supposed to be a takeoff of the Isle of Bigail from Exile 3. If you find any bugs, e-mail me at thompson@ziplink.net. You shouldn't need a hint file, it's pretty straightforward. If you do, e-mail me.GraphicsThanks to: Tim Farland and Nathan HamiltonBeta-TestingOlivier Monnin, Brian Kriedowskri, Ivan Godard, J. Reeve and Adam Neely Party Maker	This is my party maker, not an adaption of Tarl Kudrick's. To use it, go on the conveyor belt and keep on stepping on the special until you have a level 20 6 PC party, a level 24 5 PC party, a level 30 4 PC party, or a level 40 3 PC party. Then talk to the golem, and buy lots of stuff. When you're done, go to the portal and say yes. You're ready for the scenario!Thanks,Ryan ThompsonVersion 1.0.1¥Fixed SDF Conflicts¥Improved Mage BaseVersion 1.0.2¥Mass Spell Check¥Fixed Truncated Messages¥Fixed Empty Towns¥Changed Some Graphics¥Made Outdoors More Real¥Took Out Most Vahnatai Floor :(¥Made Variable Town Exits Work! :)Version 1.0.3¥People More Talkative :D¥Added Custom Graphics¥Fixed Item Bugs¥Ignored Bob Degrading in Beta-Reports (Bob will appear a lot!)Version 1.0.4¥Fixed It Up For The CD¥Made Mage Base A Lot Harder

_Wise Man of the Mountain_
Version 1.0.4

Notes:
1.  Sorry about the bugs in the previous versions!  I *thought* that we'd caught all of them during testing.  (Humph.  Some tester Chatty turned out to be.)  Anyway, if you find anymore, you can e-mail story_of_joe@hotmail.com, which is my temporary e-mail for now.
2.  Remember when I said, "If you ever see an evil altar in an odd place, be certain to try and get rid of it ..." ?  Well, forget about it for now.  It isn't working properly yet.  Something went really screwy with the nodes or something. ;-(

That's all ...

General Tips</font></b><p>"Destiny of the Spheres" is the third adventure in the "Spheres" Trilogy.It is highly recommended that you play the first two scenarios, "Riddleof the Spheres," and "Quests of the Spheres," before playing this scenario.While this scenario stands on its own, a party that works its way up throughthe first two scenarios will be quite suited to this adventure, and referencesto previous adventures will make more sense to the player. A "traditional"six character party should have an average of 30 levels per character tostart this adventure.<p>I have included a "Destiny" Party Maker (thanks to Tarl Kudrick forthe model) for those of you who want to create a party from scratch. Evenif you have a party ready to use, if you haven't played "Quests of theSpheres" and obtained the Singing Sword, Halberd, and Mace, they are availablein the Party Maker. Just run it, avoid the gold and experience specials,pick up the weapons, and exit the Party Maker. This is NOT absolutely necessary,but the weapons are nice.<p>"Destiny" is listed as a Very High Level (30th level+) adventure, and"Destiny" was designed for a starting party with an average of 30 levelsper character. Parties that don't match this description will find "Destiny"too hard or too easy.<p>This adventure is fairly open-ended. There is no sequence of questsor missions you must go on. Half the fun of this adventure is figuringout just what you must do! For those of you who need definite goals, see<a href="#A1">tipA1</a> below.<p><b>Water</b> - Make sure you always have enough water. If you run out&amp; die, even the BoE Character Editor can't help! Pay attention to wherewater is available. You can carry up to 10 units of water. Be smart. Ifyou have 9 units of water and come upon another one-shot water supply,don't use it just then. Wait until you need it. On the other hand, if youare travelling into the unknown, stock up on water before you leave.<p><b>Resources</b> - Trainers, food sellers, etc. are in short supplyin this scenario. Given where you are, this is perfectly logical. Gripeif you will, but I thought long and hard on this and to add any other "sitesof hospitality" would totally destroy the realism of the scenario.<p><b>Mapping</b> - The Ribbon is a dark place. The maps reflect this.Keep careful notes where caves, towns, and cities are, and how to get fromplace to place. Otherwise, you will stumble around in the desert quitea bit, wasting valuable water. If you just can't find a place, see <a href="#L1">tipL1</a> below.<p>None of this adventure is timed, so you have plenty of time to explore,take side trips, etc.<p><b>Spells</b> - High level (5th, 6th, and 7th) Mage and Clerical spellscan be found throughout this adventure. The ideal party will start withno 6th &amp; 7th level spells. In my opinion, a party initially loadedwith 6th and 7th-level spells will have far too easy a time in this scenario'sbattles. Of course, you are welcome to disagree with me. Use the providedBoE character editor to give your characters these spells, if you so desire.<p><b>The Power of Music</b> - You begin the scenario with The Power ofMusic, a wild power that will do different things at different times. Itappears as a special item. Its use is unlimited, but it does take timeto 'charge up' between uses. Use it when you are in the toughest situations.<p><b>Misc</b>. - One special being, Null, will harass the characters severaltimes until they utterly destroy it. There is no away around this.<p>"Destiny" contains puzzles that require some thought. I've tried tobalance this adventure between hack-'n-slash, puzzles, and a decent storyto tie it all together. I'll let you decide how well I've succeeded.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<p><b><font size=+1>2.&nbsp;<a NAME="Letters from Home"></a>Letters fromHome</font></b><p>Some outdoor specials will allow you to contact the realm of the Spheres.Pay VERY close attention to these specials, as they offer you informationand power.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<p><b><font size=+1>3.&nbsp;<a NAME="Experience Points"></a>ExperiencePoints</font></b><p>In addition to the normal accumulation of experience points, you willreceive bonus points when you accomplish certain tasks. Many times thiswill be enough to boost you a level.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<p><b><font size=+1>4.&nbsp;<a NAME="Mountain Passages"></a>Mountain Passages</font></b><p>These corridors link several sections of the Ribbon together.

Gather all three Library Cardsso you have access to the various levels of Library. One card is locatedon Marmenill in the Womb, one is in Barg's fort, and one is in Scab. Findone part of the Purity Gem in Buboe. Go to Spak's fort and recover a bottleof concentrated acid. Go to the Mountain Passage with water in it. Usethe vial of concentrated acid to open a thick steel door. Find the concentratedhealing potion in the area behind this door. Go to Shat's fort and recoverthe violin and the other part of the Purity Gem. Join the two sectionsof the Purity Gem together. Take the concentrated healing potion and theviolin back to Smithers in the Rebel Cave. You will heal his hands withthis potion. Smithers will then travel with you until you reach the Library.Once there, he will open a way in for you and destroy all the guards. Lookfor a secret passge on the west side of the Library that leads around tothe back of the Library. Fight your way to the upper levels and place thePurity Gem in the correct place, then get out! This will incapacitate theLibrary and the Squiggles.<p><a NAME="R1"></a>R1.

Look for a secret passage in Marmenill's quarters,in the <a href="#Rebel Cave">Rebel Cave</a>.<p><a NAME="8A"></a>8A. There is a secret passage to the next level at19, 15.<p><a NAME="9A"></a>9A. If you push just button one, then sit in the chair,your alchemy skill will increase by three points. If you push just buttontwo, then sit on the chair, your item lore will increase by three points.If you push both buttons, then sit on the chair, you lose both three pointof alchemy skill and three point of item lore skill. There is a hiddenroom to the immediate west of this room. It contains several energy bars.<p><a NAME="9B"></a>9B. To unlock the door to the third level, you mustenter the Flora Research area and join two loose wires together.<p><a NAME="9C"></a>9C. You need the stone key (found near Marmenill'sbody) from the next level down, the Womb, to open this door.<p><a NAME="10A"></a>10A. You must collect void boulders and toss themin all the tiny vortexes you find. When you do so, the path to the northwill open up.<p><a NAME="13A"></a>13A. You must locate two Large Runed Rocks, placethem in barrels, and push the barrels into the center area of the lair.Switch to Combat mode if you have trouble pushing barrels through the narrowcorridors. (An alternate strategy is to drop a rock where you are standing,move a space closer to the center, pick the rock up, drop it in front ofyou [thus moving the rock two spaces], repeat until the rock is safelyinside the central chamber.)

Version HistoryKnown Bugs/GlitchesCustom, wandering outside monsters appear as random pieces of terrain and/or monsters that randomly change as they move about. I can't fix this; it's a BoE bug.Outdoor fights take place on terrain that is unlike the Ribbon terrain. In other words, usually stone floors, with an occasional pool of water. This is unfortunate, but the only way to fix it would be to replace a large number of lower-number graphics with custom graphics. Some testing I did on this caused memory errors in a Mac environment. So, for this scenario, I am forced to leave things the way they are. In a later scenario, Masks, I WAS able to fix this. Why it worked in Masks and not here is a mystery; perhaps it has to do with the large number of outdoor areas in Destiny.The white dots on one-time outdoor encounters (and some town encounters) should disappear after the encounter, but don't. There is no easy way to make this happen with a custom graphic (according to Jeff Vogel), so my compromise is to make sure on second and subsequent hits on these specials, a message appears telling you what happened on the special.Adamantine is spelled Adamentine in this scenario. Those D'kar are terrible spellers!In the Void Gates, you MUST destroy the monster guarding the lever before the lever will work properly. If you attempt to use the lever before the monster is killed, you will receive a "Not while in combat." message. I actually like the fact you must destroy the monster, but not the message itself. If I think of a way to easily fix this, I will.You may encounter a monster named "Empty." These critters can be killed with one blow, and seem to appear randomly. I've seen them in other scenarios as well. BoE itself is placing them in the scenario, as far as I can tell. Until someone comes up with a way to dispose of them, or until the glitch in BoE is fixed, we all have to suffer. Hey, they're great for target practice!Occasionally during testing when entering a town, I would receive an error message about calling a node out of range. No other testers reported this. Re-opening the save file seems to fix this. My advice is to save just before entering a new town/level.One thing I know some people will critize me on are the vast open plains of the Ribbon. Originally, I had this scenario set to three times the size it is now, and planned on a much bigger plot. I cut my dreams by two-thirds. Looking at what I did, I probably could have cut the remaining outdoor sections by about another third and still maintained the feel I was looking for.  Still, each sector has several encounters, text areas, etc. - Enough, I hope, to keep people from becoming upset. If you don't like wandering about outside, please check the help file. The x,y coordinates for all major towns, etc. are included in this document.Please report all bugs to me at bxb11@psu.edu. Thanks!-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+7/18/99 - 9/15/99Beta testing round 1. Too many fixes to mention!-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+9/14/99Version 1.0 release on my web site.-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+9/21/99Version 1.0.1My thanks to Jamie Clark for many of the fix suggestions included here.Fixed glitch in Transfer Stations that allowed D'kar to cast multiple "space warps" if party was in combat mode while crossing door entrance.Made town hostile if D'kar leader in Scab is killed.Changed the water in Pule's Kitchen to small poison pools. Out of specials to tell party anything; this seems the best fix so party doesn't try and drink the water.Fixed main gate in Pule so it now is open if Pule is dead & you return to town.Fixed Null encounter in Buboe so you can't get into town without defeating Null.Fixed Basilisk so you can no longer Soul Capture them and later use them to stone everything in sight. Flame (stone?) me if you want, but this just makes the entire scenario too easy.Durok Archers now drop iron arrows, not magic ones.Void Gnomes are now somewhat weaker then before.Fixed rockslide bug in Earth mountain passage. Party can no longer pass the slide without digging it out.Fixed bug in Water mountain passage so once Guardian Golems are killed by use of machinery, they stay dead.When you return to Barg with the Staff of Fest, it was called the Staff of Pule. Now fixed.Gave some friendly Durok guards in the Slave mines a bad attitude.Added a locked door to Hydro's fount. You now need the Water Key to open this door and access the fount. 	THIS IS A MAJOR CHANGE. I SUGGEST YOU DO NOT UPGRADE TO THIS VERSION IF YOU HAVE BEEN TO HYDRO'S FOUNT OR TO PLAGUE WHILE PLAYING VERSION 1.0. IF YOU HAVE FINISHED HYDRO'S FOUNT WHILE PLAYING VERSION 1.0, YOU SHOULD BE OK.Added a hint in Plague about where to start in Hydro's Fount.Changed amount of gold on dead body in Fist of Wrath to more reasonable amount.Added some pools of lava around Fire Lizards in Fist of Wrath. Hey, they were cold!In Adamentine Fortress, added some guards in the hallways.In Void Gates, move the monsters on top of the levers so player must fight them. Changed one monster to a Void Drake.In Destroyed Adamentine Fortress, removed some misc. items from the SW corner.Managed to shrink the .meg file for Mac graphics. Don't know what was going on there, but it's fixed! Now Mac and PC downloads are approximately the same size.-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+10/22/99Version 1.0.2Added information on Marmenill and Ring of Disguise to Help File.Added tip on how to get out of Pule to Help File.Fixed bug - The text for the ground floor stairway in the Library automatically activated when you descended from the floor above. Now fixed.Added some text about the Rebels and Kyle (Lila's boy) to end of scenario messages.-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+11/2/99Version 1.0.3In Plague, the Glow Stone Vendor was mislabelled Water Vendor when purchasing from it. Fixed.One user reported that Shat was coming back to life. So, I killed him twice when Null is finally defeated.Changed the BMP file so it looks better on the PC.Removed password.-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+3/28/00Version 1.0.4Added some blocking terrain near the exit to Hydro's Fount to prevent a potential bug. Thank you, Andrew Barton.-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+12/04/01Version 1.0.5Changed Basilisks from reptile to Important monsters, to reduce the chance of Soul Capture. The original "fix" for this several versions ago didn't work.Updated documentation.

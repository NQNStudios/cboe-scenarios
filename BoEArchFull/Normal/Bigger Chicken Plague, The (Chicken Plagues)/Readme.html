<P>&#9;&#9;You may have played the Chicken Plague scenario? If so it helps, it helps even more if you have played the sequel.</P>
<P>&#9;Well now it is five years later and they are back but this time with no humans, they eat everything and shall continue to unless you stop them.</P>
<P>&#9;Visit Brave Sir Robin official Web Site <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/nininini3/ni.html">www.geocities.com/nininini3/ni.html</A> </P>

<P>&#9;Thanks to Luz Piazuelo who made this scenario possible with her fabulous graphics.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;This time around you have no annoying fights with loads of easy to kill Chickens, it is big hard fights! Yippy!</P>
<P>Thanks to everyone who complained about my other scenarios, no really thanks.</P>
<P>&#9;Hints: No Major spoilers here!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;-There is a special item in each town, spare the last one. Try to get them all, magic map spell is useful.</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;-Walk around outside with the 'fewer wandering monsters' option on, without it fights get annoying.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;-Chickens don’t drop gold! But do not fear there isn't much you can buy!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;-This scenario is designed so that you take a look around then make a large attack at the Chickens hopefully wiping them out in one big cut up.</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;-In the queens lair only hack up the queen, after that the Calvary arrive to kill off the others. I know this part of the game really should be under hard difficulty. But just cheat if stuck. I hardly ever put passwords on my scenarios.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you want a link to your site, section in the Best Artists hall of fame, some graphics or your scenario put on then just visit my website sign the guestbook or drop me a mail.</P>

TO USE THIS HINT FILE: The puzzles in this scenario are fairly much
linear. That is, you can't get stuck on puzzle 10 until you have solved
puzzle 9. They are presented in order here, along with their solutions.
Scroll down one line at a time so you don't learn anything you don't
want to know the answer to. Please only use this hint file if you
REALLY need to. There is a bit of a gap before the solutions start,
for the same reason.

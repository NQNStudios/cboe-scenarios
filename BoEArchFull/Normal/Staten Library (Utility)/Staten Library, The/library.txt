rest at. To enter the library, you will need to buy a pass from Sara. She lives to the west.

their scenario:

If you want to use the Staten Library in your scenario, that's find with me. But please do 
these things:

1. You can just use one floor, but be sure to put in the special item for that level. 

2. If you want to use all three floors, be sure to create the three special items. 

3. If you want, you can delete the three special items, and the special nodes in the library 
that use them.

4. If your using just one level, delete the stairway to the next level. 

5. Don't mess with the personaliies, because that will really ruin the library.

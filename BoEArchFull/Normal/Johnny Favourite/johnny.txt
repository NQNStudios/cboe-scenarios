*******************************Johnny Favouriteby Stephen Masel ©1999Contact: stephen_masel@hotmail.com*******************************First up, let me say this warning. "JOHNNY FAVOURITE" IS RATED *R*!!!!It contains language, drug use and violence so if you're only a young tacker, perhaps you should go get yourself a copy of "Super Mario Bros." instead.As far as I know, "Johnny Favourite" is unique among Blades of Exile games, in that it has no combat. There are no locked doors and the level of the party is completely irrelevent to the action. This doesn't mean the scenario isn't violent, it just means that if you like traipsing around slicing brigands open, perhaps you should look elsewhere."Aha!" I hear you say. "If it doesn't have monsters, then perhaps it is full of fiendish traps and riddles so ingenious, they stretch the capabilities of the Blades of Exile Scenario Editor to their limit."Alas no. There are no traps, no puzzles. Nothing more complicated in the programming than a couple of variable town entry nodes. All it has is plot.The story is very loosely based on one of my favourite movies. The name of the scenario is borrowed from one of the movie's characters. However, if I told you what the film was, and you'd seen it before, that would give away the ending, so I won't. All I'll tell you about it is that one of the stars was Lisa Bonet from the Cosby Show. (Gotta love that eighties nostalgia)The scenario was written over the last weekend in October 1999, coincidentally, just in time for submission to the Second Scenario Design Contest. Thanks to all the beta testers who worked on it since then, ie Andrew Barton, Caligula, Alcritas and any others I may have forgotten to mention.The custom graphics that aren't by me adapting Spiderweb Software's stuff are the 'Wooden Floor Set' by Ireland, the 'Wooden Wall Set' by DRKDRAXIS, the three voodoo characters by Tim Farland and the headdress was adapted by me from one of Tim's designs.XOXO StephenVersion 1.0.0Original releaseVersion 1.0.1Fixed some grammatical errorsVersion 1.0.2Fixed some more grammatical errors and Gaston now sells food

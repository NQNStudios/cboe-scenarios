Heirs To Theseus 

Thanks for downloading!  This is a quick,
very short scenario, designed to give players
a unique and difficult tactical challenge.
Apart from this text file, you should have
found two other files in the zip archive -
theseus.exs - the scenario, which you should
place in your Bladscen folder, and theseus.sav -
a saved game file, which you should place in
the main Bladexil folder.  In order to enjoy this
scenario, you should ONLY play via the saved
game file, playing with a normal party, even
a beginner party, will rob the scenario of
its challenge and enjoyment.  

This scenario is designed as a complement to
another one of my scenarios, "Of Good And Evil"
- and those who have played that scenario will
quickly realize the terrain and the situation.
(The party played here is assumed to be very
distinct from any party that has adventured in
"Of Good And Evil".)

IMPORTANT! - Do not save over the file theseus.sav.
If you want to save your game, make sure you change
the file name.

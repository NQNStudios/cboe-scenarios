A scenario by Ryan Phelps

Changing Faces is for a beginner level party, and is rated pg.  WARNING!  Use of a 
stronger party in this scenario may make it unwinnable!  Use only a beginner level party.

Thanks to all who let me use their graphics:Relhan and Alcitris.  
I'd also like to thank my alpha testers, Lance and Michael Phelps, and those who beta tested,
Gill Whitehurst and Andrew Barton.  

The graphics are essential to this scenario.  If the graphics don't work, quit and 
correct the problem.  If you are
on a mac, you will have to turn the gif (included) into a meg file.  Just make a copy of a
meg file you already have, change the name to "chanface.meg", and copy and paste the 
graphics into it.

This scenario is not easy, but don't give up!  Just make sure to read everything 
carefully, as most texts can only be read once.  There are two ways to end, to finish, 
and to complete the scenario.  Needless to say, completing the scenario is much
more fun.

Here is the list of custom graphics I used from other people.  Everything else was
done by me or taken from Zakhazi Run, and you have my permission to use them, at your 
own risk.

Relhan created the Groundbeast, Gravestone, Wraith, and Axe Champion. 
Alcitris created the fire and the Crystal Shards.

Have fun!

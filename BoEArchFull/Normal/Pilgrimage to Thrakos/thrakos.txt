== A Quick Message ==
While this is technically my second scenario, I consider it my first, since Cleanup of Skalmir Cave (The first) was a really bad scenario. No, really. It was horrid. If I could erase its very existence from the Internet, I would. However, PtT feels to me like it'll be a lot better. I went through all sorts of hell to get this in on time.

This scenario was part of the Randomized Scenario Contest. I was in college at the time the contest began, but I lost my flash drive for two weeks (about half of the original contest design time). I found it in a pair of socks. Around this same time I was dealing with a lot of crap in Real Life, including finding a new host for my website and dealing with familial troubles. Anyway, I got Pilgrimage done, sure, not as well as it could've been, but it's done. More than I can say for a lot of my other ideas.

I was originally planning on making it friendly for both singletons and group parties (I personally prefer singletons myself) but that never really panned out. So, if you play as a singleton, pretend you have severe multiple personality disorder or something.

But most of all, have fun, and feel free to rate this sucker in the CSRs...

Thanks,
Sylae.

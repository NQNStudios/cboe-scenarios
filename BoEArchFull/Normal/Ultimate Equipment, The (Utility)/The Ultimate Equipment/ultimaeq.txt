 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The Ultimate Equipment <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

by Slith Lord


This is a scenario for parties at Lvl. 50 who want to get the best equipment avaible for no money, or for parties who are about Lvl.35-50 and don«t want to get stronger by an editor.

This little scenario (utility) was not made for specific scenarios, so you won«t find anything that has to do with another scenario. Use this scenario Only if you are at least a bit over Lvl. 35, otherwise you won«t survive everything!


The scenario includes:
1. All pieces of equipment for 1 Person (enter the scenario again if you got more than one guy), with 1 weapon for each class + Lockpicks, a Rifle, Poison for your weapon, a very strong scroll and a perfect version of Ambrosia;
2. A popular and dead Vahnatai who will train you;
3. Special Enemies which can be fought in a small arena to gain skill points and XP;
4. A neverending source of gold and food;
5. A second half-hidden level of the tower you are in with four small Remembrance Halls for each known race on Ermarian;
6. A hidden gift item, which can be VERY useful;
and 7. an altar for praying to any god(s) who will take you back to the BoE main screen.

Have fun with this little world!

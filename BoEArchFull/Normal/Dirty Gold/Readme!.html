Comments? Criticisms? Email me at ryan@dougphelps.com</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b><i>Timril Plains. The only thing here easier to find than gold... is death.</i></b></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left">Dirty Gold is made for a one PC party. I didn't include the     party required, as it always becomes corrupted. Instead, I included a step     by step instruction sheet entitled &quot;How To Make April.&quot; Please open     this up and use it before you start my scenario. It is important that you     use the party April, as Dirty Gold has been hand tailored for her, and you     could get stuck using a higher level party.</p>  <p align="left">A graphics file is also included. Mac users will have to convert     the gif to an meg, as they too become corrupted when compressed in zip format.     It is quite simple to do: just make a copy of another graphics sheet (such     as Valley of Dying Things) change the name to past.meg, open it up in ResEdit     (you can get that at Apples website) and paste the graphics from the gif over     the graphics on the sheet.</p>  <p align="left">Dirty Gold is not an easy scenario, but don't give up! Keep     trying. If you have a lot of trouble, just email me. HINT: Ask Dave for anything     you might need.</p>  <p align="left">I'd like to thank my Beta testers, Lance and Michael Phelps,     who showed me that trying to write meaningful dialog at 1 A.M is NOT possible.</p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left"><font size="5">Have Fun!</font></p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left"><font size="2">Oh, yes. One more thing... There is an easter     egg somewhere in this scenario. Think you can find it? If you do, you will     get... uh, I don't know, I'll think of something.</font></p></div></body></html>

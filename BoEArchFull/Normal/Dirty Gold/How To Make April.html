Why don't I just include the party     file? Because 90 percent of the time, it gets corrupted. I've made this guide     as easy as possible, so you'll have April up and running in no time. </p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left">STEP 1: Create a new party in Blades of exile. Leave it just     as it is, and save it.</p>  <p align="left">STEP 2: Open the party in the BoE editor. Delete everyone's     items. </p>  <p align="left">STEP 3: Edit Jenneke's traits. Take away Magically Inept and     add Toughness.</p>  <p align="left">STEP 4: Edit Jenneke's statistics. Raise health to 30, raise     intelligence to 5, and raise pole weapon skill to 6.</p>  <p align="left">STEP 5: Change the parties gold to 0.</p>  <p align="left">STEP 6: Save the party, leave the party editor, and enter the     scenario <i><b>Dirty Gold</b></i> with the party. </p>  <p align="left">STEP 7: Delete all other party members EXCEPT Jenneke.</p>  <p align="left">STEP 8: Change Jenneke's name to April, and give her the female     with a lyre (harp) graphic.</p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>

Enormously Inconvenient By JATZ

This is my first scenario so I hope you enjoy it as much as I did 
creating it. Its intended for about level 14 characters. I think I got 
rid of all the bugs and type errors, but there may still be some 
lurking in there.... Any way if you have any questions, bug reports 
etc, please send them to: 

andy@samtoby.freeserve.co.uk

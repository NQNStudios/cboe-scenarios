This is for all those Star Wars fans out there. Yes, I like the story so much that I took a medieval type role playing game(Blades of Exile) and made a completely different, space sci/fi theme scenario(Star Wars). And yes only I am that stupid/crazy. I tried to keep the Star Wars theme intact as much as I could but it's very hard to transfer a theme from the distant future into a game based on the distant past. Anyway, the basic plot line is that you are a team of Jedi commandos on your first official mission for the New Republic(this term will probably be new to those who don't read the Star Wars novels, but it's pretty self-explainitory). I suggest using a fairly experienced party because while I did give you powerful armor and weapons right up front, the enemy is probably too tough for newbies. I would like to say that most of the ideas, names, terms, characters, and themes are not mine. To name the entire list of people I "borrowed" ideas from would take another ten pages. So even though some of these ideas were created by me, I won't take credit for those either...just in case:). If anyone really has a problem with this scenario because of copyright issues, contact me and I'll be glad to give you credit, although I don't think anyone really cares enough to go to such efforts. This was beta tested by my pal Nathan Vaccaro and created by me, Brian Mardiney (jedi_initiate@hotmail.com). If you have any questions, comments, bug reports, reviews, or suggestions, feel free to use the above address. I wanted to put this scenario on the net as soon as I could so there might be a few bugs. If you spot any please e-mail me with the bug and I will fix it and send you the updated version and you can just overwrite the original with the new scenario file. Thank you for playing and "May the Force be with you".(I had to say it)

I'm not really interested in complaints, but 
if you have to make them, use the same method
as above.

MAC Users - No Meg file is included, but it's
not big problem.  Just make a copy of zrun.meg,
and rename it zedit.meg.  Ta da!

I'd like to thank The Talking Spider for proving
a bit of beta testing help.  Lew Titterton deserves
some of the credit/blame for inspiring this.

This is basically "The Za-Khazi Run", but
harder.  How is it harder?  Well, for starters,
you're only given 12 days, instead of the usual
20.  

(And yes, that's right.  In the initial version,
you were told you had 21 days, but the game starts
on day 1, and the fort falls on day 21, giving you
only 20 days.  In this version, you start on day 1,
and the fort falls on the beginning of day 13 which 
= 12 days to reach the fort before it falls.)

Small Descriptions

The story is 100% original (non-Exile-related).
Your ship was attacked by catapults and you're stuck on
an island. The people in the island are led by women.
The island has three tribes - Amazons, Immigrants and
Woodswomen. And all of them are suffering from carnage
by one man, who's called Death Header.

The island of Amazons is heading for death...

History

v0.5.5 The First Half is made. Only two women played it.
v0.8.5 Released and awarded. In fact, it lacked a good ending.
v1.0.1 The 2nd release.
       'Area Name' descriptions are corrected.
       Some empty boxes now contain items.
       Some changes in the custom graphic sheet.
       Much more detailed ending is added.
       Many small bug fixes/grammar corrections.
v1.0.2 The 3rd release.
       Word of Recall bug is fixed. (I think it's an ugly fix)
       Some dialogues are shortened.
v1.0.3 The 4th release.
       Word of Recall bug wasn't really fixed in v1.0.2, so
       I finally fixed it.
       Some dialogues are altered.

Erika's Legacy 1.1.9This scenario is meant to be a continuation of the Exile plotline, starting at a point perhaps two years after the end of Exile III.  It is not necessary to have played through the whole Exile series to enjoy this game, but those who have will recognize familiar characters and locations.This game has been extensively beta tested by my fellow AOLers, and my heartfelt thanks go to: Fridge Art, RobinRPH, PokeyTax, Suruga528, SirDidymus and BenCasey01.  Watch for them to appear as characters in the scenario, along with a few other names known by Exilophiles.There is one sort-of bug that I did not fix: if, in the very unlikely event you find Erika's locket before entering the Mystery Block, don't go into Erika's Castle first.  It will goof up the sequence of the storyline.  I apologize for this.You should be prepared to spend approximately ten hours on this scenario.  It is designed for medium level PC's.I can be emailed at: BGraceFild@aol.comBe sure to mention "Blades" or "Erika" in the title of your email as I get so much junk email I might erase your email simply because I don't recognize your name.1.1.9 update includes:  somewhat more conservative values on two special items, and a couple of minor tweaks that only I would notice.

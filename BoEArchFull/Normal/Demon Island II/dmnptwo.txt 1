----- ABOUT THE AUTHOR -----
------------- 1 -------------

For those of you who actually care about these sorts of things, my name is
Ross Yancey and I am 16 years old (At least I am as I am writing this,
which is 9-9-99). My first scenario was Demon Island (Part 1), which I
rushed through when I was making it and did not pay too much attention to
what I was doing (It scored a measly 2.6). In making Part 2, I didn't rush
through it as much and I paid much more attention to what I was doing. If
you have played my first scenario, you should know already that I am not
exactly the best writter, if you haven't you'll find out soon enough, the
dialog in Part 2 is much better I think, but it still isn't that good. I
made both scenarios to creat a challenge for high level parties, the ones
that can just blaze through any other scenario with little difficulty. In
order to stand a chance in Part 2, your characters should be levels 40+ and
have the best equipment that you can find. I suggest getting steel wave
blades and steel halberd enhanced with the flaming weapon ability, at least
2 of your characters have either a ring of speed or boots of speed (I like
the boots better), the characters who don't have a ring of resistance or
something else with the Full Protection ability will be very vulnerable
(have at least one or two, the Prismatic Armor found in the "A Small
Rebellion" scenario is excellent), and the spells that your spell casters
definitly should know are: Major Blessing (Mage), Revive (Priest), Revive
all (P), Slow Group (M), Curse All (P), Protection (M), Bless All (P) and
Ressurect (P).

-- WHAT HAPPENED IN PART 1 --
------------- 2 --------------

If you didn't complete Demon Island (Part 1), here's what you need to know.
You arrived on the island by ridding a ship with another group of
adventurers (they didn't have much to do with the plot, they just helped
you out sometimes if they hadn't died), but as you neared the island a
group of demons attacked, lead by the demon Zerivix. You fought the demons
and forced them to retreat, but the ship crashed into the island. North of
the wreckage you found the town, Mordalace, which was protected by magic
runes that repel demons. Inside Mordalace there was a casino and battle
arena and you met Nerald, the rare artifact collector, he asked you to find
the 25 orbs that were hidden all over the island (optional quest). During
your stay in Mordalace, you foiled Zerivix's plot to dig a tunnel
underground into the town. North of Mordalace, there was a cave that you
traveled through (The Nightmare Cave). After passing through the cave there
was a large mountain near the exit, you found a secret passage (Not
necessarily right then, but some time) that led to a small house that the
wizard, Harold lived in. It will be very important to remember this secret
passage, because in Part 2 he is the only one who will provide needed
services before reaching Castle Velius. You traveled west of the cave's
exit and then south, then west again and found another cave. After you went
through the cave, you traveled north and found Castle Velius. The guards
suspected that you were demons wearing magical illusions as disguises and
wouldn't let you in unless you proved that you weren't by destroying the
demons' castle to the west. East of the castle, you found a cave of
wizards. Their leader, Valgoth, helped you destroy the demons' castle
because it was creating lava all over the island, but he told you to stop
your quest to kill the demons after that, because if you continued to do
so, you would eventually anger their god, Xebon, to the point where he
would attack the island himself. You did not listen to him. After
destroying the demons' castle, you were allowed to enter Castle Velius. The
king sent you on a quest to find the sky staff and use it to control the
weather and make it snow, killing the demons (They need a hot climate to
survive). There were two parts to the staff and one of the parts of the
staff was in a cave to the north, where you fought the Fire Guardian inside
the Chaos Maze. To find the other part of the staff, you traveled all the
way back past the mountain that Harold lived in and went north. There you
went through another cave where a group of demons had captured all the
humans in a town and were feeding them to a dragon. You killed the dragon
and freed the people. You exited the cave and traveled north again, where
you found the Ice Castle. (On your way there you also found a destroyed
mansion with another optional quest) Inside the Ice Castle you fought the
Ice Guardian and got the other part of the staff. You returned to King
Velius and he told you that the wizard, Harold, knew how to activate the
staff, so you went to him (In the secret passage in the mountain,
remember?) and asked him about it. He told you that you needed to be
standing between the four obelisks of power, which were inside of Zerivix's
castle. To get there you went west and then north. You fought Zerivix, but
he stole the staff from you as he retreated, he then formed an army and
attacked Castle Velius. But with your help, Zerivix was killed and the
staff was retrieved. You returned to Zerivix's Castle and found the four
obelisks, but as you were about to use the staff, Valgoth attacked you. You
fought him and forced him to retreat. You used the staff, but Xebon (The
demons' god) used his power to stop it from snowing and as Valgoth said, he
was angry enough now that he would attack the island himself. Valgoth
proposed that he use a spell to creat a portal to another dimension where
Xebon would lose his godly powers. You tried it and it worked. Without his
immortality, you were able to defeat Xebon. That's all that happened in
Part 1.

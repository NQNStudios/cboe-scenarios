																				HINTSHOW DO I GET INTO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE GOBLINS' CAVE? WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH SIGOURNEY?Go see Enid in Kidneypuddle. She'll tell you about the secret passage to the east of the Goblin Cave where you'll meet her daughter Sigourney. Mention Enid's name to Sigourney so you can go back and claim your reward, only you won't be able to. Ask Enid about "trouble" and when you go back to the cave, there should be a hole between Sigourney's hide and the main cave. Go through, kill of everything in sight. When you bump off the Goblin Chief, you'll get the key to Sigourney's cell. Talk to her about "escape" and there should be a nice little surprise waiting for you back at Enid's shop.HOW DO I GET TO TALK TO THE PRISONER ON THE ISLAND IN KLISSS LOSSS?You can buy a boat from a guy called Dagleish in Gatwick.WHERE DO I GET THE STUFF TO PASS THE GUARDS AT THE FRONT OF THE VAHNATAI RESERVATION?You get the form off Slaika at the gate and Mayor McYogurt's signature after you've cleared up her bandit problem. The Undersecretary's seal is in a bookcase in Baba Yaga's hut in the deep south. For everyone else's signature just mention the word "sign" to Old Man Joad at the Joad farm, Gakk in Coogan's Bluff and Judge Jasper in Bundoora.WHAT'S THE PASSWORD IN THE LAIR OF THE MAD COWS?Have you checked the sign at the entrance to the abandoned temple in northwest Coogan's Bluff? Old Man Joad was right when he suspected that the priest did it. The riddle asks who was the Mad Cow's father and the sign says the missing priest was called Father Prion. Microbiologists can have a chuckle at this rather weak joke.HELP ME, I CAN'T GET TO THE MIDDLE OF CASTLE HACKENSLASH. DO I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO WIN THE GAME?No, you don't have to get through all of Castle Hackenslash to win but there's a special item in there that makes it easier. In the grounds outside the castle, hidden in the trees is a helpful little critter called Pixie Secondus who will give you all sorts of clues. I know this is supposed to be a walkthrough, but I think you should be smart enough to solve that little dilemma by yourself.I'M IN THE SPOOKY CAMP AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BOARD THIS BOAT BUT THE GAME WON'T LET ME ON THE DOCK.First you need to go to the hall and ask each kid what their theory is. Try to board the boat now and fail. Then go to the campfire area and step on or look at the corpse there. After that, you should be able to board the boat and go off to the lair of the homicidal, axe-wielding maniac.HOW DO I GET INTO GULKAN'S TOMB?First you'll need to get the Pyramid of Many Colours off Mayor McYogurt in Bundoora, then take it to Cuthbert, the little boy in Gatwick and mention it to him. He should be able to solve it so that it can be used in Gulkan's tomb.HOW DO I GET BACK INTO THE TERRARIUM TO GET ALL THAT LOVELY TREASURE I LEFT BEHIND AFTER DEFEATING CAGNEY?You can't. Ha! Ha! Ha!WHERE IS THE BANDIT'S SECRET BASE AND HOW DO I GET IN?The lair is hidden behind Ursula's guesthouse in Bundoora. Ask Ursula about "Krug" and she'll unlock the door for you so you can get in.OKAY, I MADE IT INSIDE THE BANDIT LAIR BUT THERE'S THESE NAUGHTY DOORS AND PORTCULLI I CAN'T GET THROUGH.The key to the first locked door is in the desk in the room off the library. The second is hanging on a hook behind a secret door. To get through the portcullis, you have to step on all the runes and kill all the monsters. A secret passage will then open up and you'll find a button behind it. Don't press it! Behind that secret passage is another secret passage with a lever that will open the portcullis. To get into Cagney's inner sanctum, you will need the key you got from killing the captain in Gulkan's Tomb.HOW DO I STOP CAGNEY FROM KILLING UNCLE ZEKE AND AUNTIE EM?Trust no one. They only die if you tell that nice young man Dagleish about your background on the farm.HOW DO I CROSS THE PIT IN THE VAHNATAI RESERVATION?There's a secret door in the building with the cave painting and a boat on the other side.I CAN'T FIND A DOOR IN THE CASTLE OF THE FIRST ONES. HOW DO I GET IN?You'll need to buy a Leatbles Demo Crystal from Martin in the Cavern under Kenno's Flophouse in Kidneypuddle. Stand at the far north of the indentation in the south of the castle and let the first one's weave their magic.ALL RIGHT, I'M IN. HOW DO I GET BACK OUT AGAIN?You can't get back out to Exile again. Weren't you listening to what the Vahnatai told you about never returning once you've met the First Ones? I bet you thought they were only speaking figuratively. Just typical. The only way to leave the castle is to talk to the king until he agrees to open up a wall in his throne room. On the other side are some stairs. Go down them and you'll be in the game's last dungeon.THAT ENDING WAS REALLY WEIRD WHAT THE HECK WAS IT ALL ABOUT?It's painfully clear that you're too young to remember the greatest computer game of all time: Ultima IV. The format of the Exile series is very closely related to Ultima. The display is on the left hand side, inventory in the top right corner and the text below it. Have a look at those download sites and see for yourself.

The Silver BladesThere isn't much to this scenario, yet here's the basic plot line.You are in the scenario to get rid of a group of drakes.  Your first assignment, go to the commander of fort Sweetwater (the place you started in).  Talk, get supplies.  Then go out of the fort and proceed east.  When you get to the forest go south until you reach the two rocky outcropings.  The trees in between them are able to be passed through.  Head north until you get to the road, go east.  When you get to the town head north.  Talk to the council of Silver Blades, get the cross (special item).  Go out of the castle and go back to the town, head east.  When you get to the area where the road branches off you can head south to the tower (this is a side mission and is not required) talk to Arean (he's the only human in the tower).  If you keep heading east you should come to a place where the road heads to the south (this leads to a town with a mansion for purchase (if you played Exile 3 this is like "Hawke's Manse", yet no spirit) this is a good place to stock up on food, rest, and store items.  If you head east you should come to a tower.  Inside the tower hear east until you come to the pillar-like thing.  Wait until you get the "it rings the correct time" and pass through the pillar (you have ten turns after you get the message, don't worry the message repeats every 100 or so turns).  Exit the tower and head in a southerly direction.  Somewhere along the mountain range is a secret pass through the mountains.  This leads to a passage into the underground section of Thaor Manse, (another side mission).  If you continue south you will come to a section of rocks across the water.  This will lead you into a mountain pass which will take you into the drake cave, when you enter the cave, head north and east, go into the "throne cave" and fight the battle.  When you're done head back by reversing the directions and head out the south entrance of Fort Sweetwater.

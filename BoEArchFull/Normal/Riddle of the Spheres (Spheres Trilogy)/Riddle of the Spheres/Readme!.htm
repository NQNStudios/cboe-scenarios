At first, this was attributed to lack ofartistic freedom - the musicians wanted to disappear. Later, themages of the Empire discovered the truth.</P><P>An invisible, roving gate that opened to another dimension wasrevealed. The gate was activated by music itself. You could besinging or even be just thinking about a song, and when the gatepassed over you, you were transported to another place.</P><P>It took the Empire mages over 50 years to track, stabilize, andeventually control the gate. When the first bold adventurers steppedthrough the now stable portal, they were astounded. The landconsisted of a large number of islands floating in the ether! Someislands had formed chains - they were more or less bound together bytough, thick vines, making travel between isles possible.</P><P>Descendents of the people who had travelled there over the yearshad formed loose communities and even had built some small cities.The most amazing discovery of all, however, was the Music of theSpheres.</P><P>These seven orbs existed in a large clearing on the island wherethe portal opened in the "Realm of the Spheres," as this place becameknown. The source of great music and magic, it naturally attractedmany mages and musicians alike.</P><P>The Realm is a peaceful place, quite separated from the dailystrife in the Empire. But something is awry. You have been calledhere on a priority one distress signal.</P><P>The Empire doesn't consider you the best choice for this job -just the closest. Additional troops are on the way. You are to reportto Empire Liaison Jarl as soon as you arrive in the Realm of theSpheres.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Installation</B></P><P>Place the <B>spheres.exs</B> file in the <B>Blades of ExileScenarios</B> folder on the Mac, or the <B>Bladscen</B> folder on thePC.</P><P>Place the <B>spheres.meg</B> file in the <B>Blades of ExileScenarios</B> folder on the Mac.</P><P>Place the <B>spheres.bmp</B> file in the <B>Bladscen</B> folder onthe PC.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Playing Tips</B></P><P><I>General</I></P><P>Go see the Empire Liaison as soon as possible. He will give yousome much needed gold.</P><P>Equip yourself immediately after you see the Empire Liaison. Nakedadventurers don't last long.</P><P>This scenario was specifically designed for low-level characters.Experience playing Exile I, II, and/or III will be to your favor.This scenario was tested with the default party generated by Bladesof Exile. They were able to overcome every encounter successfully. Ifyou have an encounter you consider impossible to completesuccessfully, you may want to consider returning to that encounter ata later time, after building skills and adding spells. The encountersare not ordered; you should be able to go in any direction from thestart and still be successful.</P><P>Having two level three magic users will really help with all earlyencounters.</P><P>You must have a character with the ability to cast 'MoveMountains.'</P><P><I>Storage</I></P><P>You can store items in two places - The Spheres Hotel, on PortalIsle (the starting isle), and in Sour Note, a city on an isle to theSouthwest of Portal Isle.</P><P><I>Moving from Isle to Isle</I></P><P>A number of people have had this problem. You may have to pokearound the edge of an isle to find the invisible path from the isleto the bridges. It's there, but it's not as easy to find as it shouldbe. I can't join the bridges directly to the isles; it would reallyscrew up the graphics.</P><P><I>The Tests of The Master</I></P><P>Many people get stuck in the Master's castle in the room with manyfences. There is a way out! You'll need to use a certain spell; it'sthe same one you've already used in that room to get from one sectionto another. Here's where you use it (<B><I>spoiler</I></B>, spelledbackwards): moorforenroctfelreppu.</P><P><I>The Alien Tome</I></P><P>This serves no purpose in this scenario, but will in the next!</P><P>I'll add to this section as I receive feedback from players.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Bugs and Suggestions</B></P><P><I>General</I></P><P>I need to know about the obvious it-doesn't-work bugs. I also needto know about conceptual flaws in my design. Was an encounter tooeasy? Too hard? Did you understand the characters you talked to? Wereyou able to get the information you needed from them? I will fixbugs. I will consider fixing conceptual flaws if several peopleconcur on the flaw. Hey, what do you want for free? You can e-mail meat bxb11@psu.edu. I'll try to respond quickly, but as a grad student,full-time employee, and father, I make no promises.

Abyss is a scenario created for the Don't Fix the Shark Competition.
This contest requires that the contestant places limitations on himself.
As such, my entry is limited in the following ways:
	One Town
	No Outdoors
	No Movement
	No Custom Graphics
	No more than 20 nodes
This scenario was beta-tested by Terror's Martyr. Thanks TM!

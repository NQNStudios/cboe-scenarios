Hint file for "Trouble in Mendor."  These are not quite spoilers, but you may not want to read on if you want to work things out on your own.  These are based on the most common questions I have received in the time since the scenario was posted.  They are listed roughly in the order most people will probably take in this quasi-linear plot, though it is possible with this design to go right to the end.Library-  You do need mage lore to get much from the private and special collections.  If you have at least 3 pts in your party you will find something, but many spells are at 6 or higher.I have "X", now what?-  You are not done until you find the pirate lair and defeat them.  You will need to talk to people to find the clues to point you in the right direction.  Hint- it is in N. Mendor.Tower-  How do you get across the bridge?  I have modified this a bit in version 1.1 so this hint may not be as necessary, but keep in mind what Kalman said.  If you don't rembember, you can always start a new game and go right to him...Kurza's-  "Where are the stairs?"  Who says stairs need to look like stairs when doorways move you about?  Once you have the key (check the note with the nephil) you will find the stairs with just a bit of looking.  Without it you won't.					-how do I get out?  There are two ways- one involves searching on the second floor, the other talking to someone on the first.Under Mendor 2-  "I am stuck here.  What happened?"  Well, don't push all the crates in the water...

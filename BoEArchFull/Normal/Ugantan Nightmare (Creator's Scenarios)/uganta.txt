Ugantan Nightmare

A movie scenario by The Creator

*************************************************************

Thank you for downloading this extremely brief scenario. The
.zip file should contain the following items:

uganta.txt
uganta.bmp
uganta.meg
uganta.exs

uganta.txt - The readme file, which you are reading right now.

uganta.bmp - The custom graphics file for PC users. These are
essential to the scenario and must be working properly. 

uganta.meg - The same thing, but for Mac users.

uganta.exs - The scenario itself. This is likely to be the 
shortest scenario you will play in your life. Play time should 
take less than a minute.

Strictly speaking, this isn't even a scenario. It is, for all 
pratical purposes, a movie. The prescence of your party is only
because there is no other way to do it in Blades of Exile.

I don't know for certain how well it will work on other computers. 
It has not been beta-tested. I didn't really see the point in it 
for something so small.

This scenario was constructed for two reasons. First, to 
form part of the story that was begun in The Isle of Boredom.
If you have not played it, you will most likely understand
none of the events of this scenario.

Secondly, and more importantly, to showcase a new animation
technique. details of this technique can be found below if you
wish to use it yourself.

Thanks to Shisha for the "Robed Figure" graphic and to Tim 
Farland for the "Blackheart" graphic, both of which are used 
in this scenario. All other custom graphics are either originals
or edits by myself.

Frame Animation
******************

This is the method that I used to create this scenario. I have
several towns full of frozen scenes, each slightly different 
from the next. With stairway nodes, I moved the
party from one to the next in rapid succession. I would 
occasionally intersperse this with various nodes such as sound
effects or explosions.

One problem with this is speed. Everything happens very fast. To
slow everything down enough for the player to absorb what is
happening, it is often necessary to enter the same scene 
multiple times. I also recommend playing sounds at every 
opportunity, as these take some time to play. For example, you 
will hear footstep noises very frequently in this scenario.

Another problem that can arise is an inability to see everything
clearly. I got around this by making all terrain transparent.

A third and much more serious problem arises when you approach
the 50-node chain limit, and trust me, this doesn't take long at
all. To beat this, you paste several different nodes (using the 
paste command on the toolbar) that each start an animation chain
onto the same spot. When the first node chain ends the next one 
will begin. 

The order that the node chains are called in depends 
on the number of the first node in the chain. i.e. If the nodes 
pasted on the one spot are 0, 5, 2, and 7, the chain that begins 
with node 0 will go first, followed by the one that begins with 
node 2. Then will come nodes 5 and 7, in that order.

Every chain that is followed by another MUST end in the same town 
that it started in. You can flip from town 34 to town 73 to town 8
in the meantime, but it has to end in the same town as the first
node of the next chain.

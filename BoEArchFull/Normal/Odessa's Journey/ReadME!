Odessa's Journey

	This is a scenario I wrote basically as an experiment, just to try out a few things. It's mostly a linear combat-geared scenario so it can be beat quickly (it is also rather small).

TIPS
It is a very, very good idea to know the spell firewalk. Also very useful are major haste, and firestorm. I'm not sure exactly how hard it is. A beginning party cannot beat it, though.


Problems?
	I can be reached through e-mail at cddiem@yahoo.com.
	Yes I know that the first goblin encounter doesn't disappear like it should, but I can't seem to fix that.
	I also know that occasionally Odessa may show up when she's supposed to be missing, there doesn't appear to be a way to fix that either.
	I also know that the "safe house" I designed has a weird side effect. I can't fix that either, so clumsily made it part of the story.

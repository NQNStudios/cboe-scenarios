THE NEPHILS' DEFENSE by Bain-Ihrno
Scenario Readme File

  I originally planned for this scenario to stay
unreleased, as The Creator give a "HARSH" beta report
which made the scenario look horrible. However, 
Creator and Gizmo BEGGED for the release of this
scenario, Creator convinced me, and I decided my
only choice now is to release the scenario.

Moral of the story: Don't expect this to be a good
scenario.

   Anyway, in this scenario, you play as a highly-respected
Nephilim archer named Crawlin. You live on an island
split into two halves by artificial mountains created
by Nephil wizards. Why? Two tribes of Nephilim have
had disagreements with each other, and they are split up.

But the other tribe suddenly attacked you, and it is up
to you to find out why and stop them! Enjoy!

General Notes and Tips:

1. Please try to imagine that everyone here is speaking
in the Nephilim language. I only used English so that
you can understand what everyone is saying.

2. This scenario uses a pre-fab party (of course.) If 
the file doesn't work for you, you will need to use the
stats listed below to make Crawlin.

3. This scenario HAS A TIME LIMIT! There's only two side
quests, but you will need to play fast if you try to
undertake them both.

4. If you open up the graphics, you may notice
some pink lines. That's where some graphics were that
I decided not to use.

5. If there's a moldy wall in your way, ATTACK IT to bring it down. 
You have no magic in this game. Unfortunate, huh?

6. DO NOT and I mean DO NOT go to the checkpoint until
you are well equipped! The battles are tough and there is
very little hospitality for you beyond that point!

7. Always search containers that you see near you. There's
usually something nice there...

8. If you see an evil altar, always try to sanctify it.
There could be something useful...

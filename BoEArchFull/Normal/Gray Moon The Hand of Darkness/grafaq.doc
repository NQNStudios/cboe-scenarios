Gramoon v. 1.0.7Last Updated 9/12/02By Frahhamn [anschauung@juno.com]FAQ & HINTS FOR GRAMOON v. 1.0.6cThis file was created because of my insufficient memory.I have been known to give bad directions, so I wrote the right onesdown. These work. I've tried most of them.If they DON'T work...   1. Maybe the directions weren't followed.       REMEDY: Follow the directions.   2. It could be you repeated a step by pulling a lever earlier, and then pulling it again while following the instructions.       REMEDY: Try pulling possible repeated levers.... AND/OR... Try "un-pulling" all of the levers & starting over.   4. You don't know why. PERIOD.       REMEDY: Figure it out.... OR... EMAIL ME!   3. You suspect there is something wrong with my scenario.       REMEDY: EMAIL ME! LET ME KNOW!   ANSWERS TO TIGHT SPOTS IN GRAMOON:[02/07/01]>> What's the answer to the riddle on painting?  [--This actually could have had several answers, but this was even in the info about it: "...a one-man fight against death itself..."--]  The answer is 'Death'>> How do I Get the boat past the obnoxious wall in water?  [--This was for those who like puzzles. This is nowhere near the obvious. It requires some experimenting.     NOTE(4/27/01) Perhaps this shouldn't have been here. Since all the other levers are reset upon the exit of a town.--]  Make sure lever in Maton Manor has been pulled(first pull registers, second unregisters it... third registers it... and so on)  Return to Under Maton Manor, go past painting and across bridge.  Pull lever in library.  Return and pull lever in Maton Manor. Just do it. (first pull registers, second unregisters it... third registers it... and so on)  Return to Under Maton Manor and pull button by water.  Ta-da! A bridge! Go across, fight bad guys and find passage...  Continue in passage along hallway and pull lever by window.  The wall is gone.  Get the boat over to the bridge that leads to the painting.  NOTE: You will never have any need to pull or push these buttons/levers again, unless you leave without freeing the     boat. Then just push the one by the water. If you do push buttons and leave your boat by a bridge in the middle of the water...     You'll just have to fiddle around again with the levers until the bridges come back. But to save a lot of time, leave them      alone.[04/27/01]>> I can't find a pebble to get past the portcullis. Can you help? Is this found later on?   [--Just a quick answer--]   You've got to reach a teleporter within a time period of pulling a lever.   Then it takes you to the chest and the black pebble. Then you need to go   back up a level to get the iceshield past the portcullis. Then back down to   get to the same teleporter and go down the stairs, now that you can get past   the flames, and get the key that allows you to continue later on.   Then you go to another or the same lever/teleporter set-up. This takes you   to the stairs beyond the magical barriers.Still stuck? REMEDY: Email me and I'll add your problem to this file!Frahhamn [anschauung@juno.com]

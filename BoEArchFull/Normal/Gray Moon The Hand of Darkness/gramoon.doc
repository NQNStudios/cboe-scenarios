Grey Moon: The Hand of Darkness               v. 1.0.7Last updated: 9/12/02  (If this date seems old or you encounter any bugs, please email me at   my address below.)NOTICE:     Windows users:       Make sure that the GRAMOON.BMP      file is in the bldscen folder.     MAC users:      Sorry, you guys will have to find a image      converter to convert it to a .MEG format.****WITHOUT THIS FILE THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE!!!!!!****NOTE: This game is designed for a -ONE- PC     party. Either use the one enclosed or     create one from scratch with GOOD archery     and some thrown missles. You will have to     use to the PC editor to bring him/her up     to speed.     DO NOT USE A PARTY WITH SPELL LEVELS!!!     You will lose them all. Bummer, huh? But part of the     story-line is that you don't believe in magic.     DO NOT REMOVE PARTY FROM ANY OF THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE     MATON MANOR! THE BOAT WILL BE PERMENANTLY STUCK OUT OF      REACH OF YOUR PC! YOU DON'T WANT THAT.Rating:PG - Just because I felt that some people     (probably not you) could be offended     by something in this. There isn't much,     but that was for caution's sake.Difficulty:Very Hard - This is how hard the scenario is,     Not the party level. This ~IS NOT~ a next-     to-impossible scenario. It just requires     getting used to fighting undead, and more     undead.      It actually starts to get VERY hard towards     the end. And the last battle requires some     ingenuity.History: -- v. 1.0.1 - Grey Moon started. -- v. 1.0.2 - Grey Moon nearly completed,               several signifgant bugs corrected -- v. 1.0.3 - Several more towns added -- v. 1.0.4 - Major bugs corrected. -- v. 1.0.5 - Grey Moon inflicted on the unsuspecting               general public!(Huzzah!) -- v. 1.0.6a - Grenade bug fixed,               Fixed unreachable room(Gardens),               Fixed Switchblade from bashing to edged. -- v. 1.0.6b - Grenades join together		   Fixed Silver necklace s.i. bug. -- v. 1.0.6c - Fixed grand finale crash.		   Trapped behind door bug		   Kills all undead when big bad guy killed.	         New custom graphics made (new ones later?) -- v. 1.0.7 - New creature added               Ghoul graphics fixed up               Bigger ending battle.CREDITS:Debugging:       Jjudvven, Bruce Mitchell, Andrew Barton(sorry if I left off your name)Custom Graphics: FrahhamnAnd I feel compelled to thank Jeff Vogel for BoE.

Scroll down?A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC HINTS: ~ Dark Ghouls have paralyzing touch. One   hit and you're probably going to die. ~ There are many other passages inside passages. ~ Stock up on silver bullets whenever you can.   Gold bullets aren't a fraction as useful.Not enough?

Well, if you'rehonestly stuck, or just plain don't want to have to workvery hard... email me. I'm doing this, so that when I getyour name, I can tell everyone else that you're a wimp. Naw,just kidding. It's fine with me if you want advantages thatthe PC Editor won't give you, but I'm making it less of atemptation.

Dark Side of the Moon v1.00 Readme:

Thank you for downloading Dark Side of the Moon, my latest scenario for Blades of Exile. 
I hope you will enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it. 

Introduction:

On Plainridge Island, things were going quite smoothly. Until their was a total 
eclipse of the sun. This is normally normal. But days have passed, and the solar 
eclipse was still not over. People then began to suspect an evil force is at work. 
You've been called to Plainridge Island to figure out what could be responsible for 
the eclipse.

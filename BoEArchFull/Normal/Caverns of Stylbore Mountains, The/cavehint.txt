Welcome to the Caverns of Stylbore Mountains help file.  First a free hint- save regularly and keep a couple old versions around.  Just like in life, this scenario requires that you do some things in some semblance of order.  If you don't, you might find yourself trapped with no way out, or even killed.  (Ever try getting out of a car before slowing to a stop and turning off the engine?)  Unlike life, we can make backups of games we play, and thus not lose to much by simple errors.  This is a good idea.How to use this file:There are questions and each question has a number associated with its answer.  Then look up the answer in the answer table.  Hopefully this will keep you from getting answers to questions you do not need or want yet.If you have other suggestions, please pass them along.

To use it, make up a party of 1st level characters and then enter the scenario cavehlpm.exs and follow the directions.  This will generate a party of appropriate level and skill, though slightly poorer in equipment than a party which has adventuring experience.BackgroundBefore the complete domination of the world by the Empire, the Archmage Ra'azat made a home in the Stylbore mountains and sent his minions out to conquer the surrounding areas.  He was so successful that the surrounding lands of Edom and Kush were subjugated for almost a century and vast treasures were brought to the Archmage's lair.  Legend states that the Archmage gained his greatest power from discovering a series of natural caverns, where he unleashed hidden magic of unsurpassed might.  There he gathered a vast library and a horde of gems, jewels, and magic, rumored to include both the fabled Mirror of Viewing and a magical Cage of Entrapment. It is certain Ra'azat ruled Stylbore and the surroundings from these caverns, and conducted extensive research in summoning demons from there.Alas, even with both magic and the vast knowledge of the caverns extending his life, Ra'azat's dominion came to an end.  An apprentice accidentally erased part of a protection glyph, and a powerful demon was freed.  The battle was extensive; while the demon had to retreat to the netherworld, Ra'azat was rendered severely feebleminded.  With the loss of his strength and power his realm fragmented and collapsed.  Edom and Kush fought to claim the wealth that was there.  Slaves and servants rebelled.  His treasure was looted, his riches dispersed.  The Archmage used the last of his power to secure some of his wealth and most prized possessions, preparing one last hiding place in the caverns which were his stronghold.  He cast spells to hide the caverns for hundreds of years and set up guards and wards to protect his final holdings from  treasure seekers and intruders.That Ra'azat is dead can not be doubted, but his influence lingered long after his death.  Even when the Empire was at its peak, the Stylbore mountains were never fully under its control.  In spite of extensive patrols and efforts, the mountains were often the source of strange sightings and beasts, and served as a refuge for those willing to hide, keep a low profile, and wait.  Now, with the waning of the Empire's omnipotence, the holdings of Edom and Kush are experiencing renewal, and with that the resumption of the historical competition between the two regions over the territory and potential wealth of the Stylbore mountains.You have been hired by Sir Gye, an agent of Duke Pellinore, ruler of Kush, to find the fabled caverns, search them, and recover several specific items.  It was thought at one point that all the wealth had been removed, but recent investigations (which Sir Gye does not describe further) have indicated that both the Mirror and the Cage did exist, and that Ra'azat had possession of them both.  Neither of the items have been heard of since, indicating that perhaps they are still somewhere in the caverns.Sir Gye explains that for "political reasons" neither he nor the Duke can search for these items themselves or acknowledge that a search is occurring.  It is vital that these items, the Mirror and the Cage, as well as what remains of the Library, not fall into the hands of the Prince of Edom.  He has commissioned you to find them and return them to him.Welcome to the scenario "The Caverns of Stylbore Mountains."  This scenario contains a primary mission, described above, as well as several side quests which you may come across.  Most of the side quests are not required to complete the primary goal, but will be quite useful to gain experience and treasure which will help you when you finally reach the Caverns.  The scenario does not have any formal towns or cities as such, so there is really nowhere that you can return to and rest, re-equip, etc.  Everything necessary for adventure and advancement is available, but you will have to find it.  Since this is "the great outdoors", life progresses while you adventure and you will need to use opportunities as you find them.This adventure has a different feel than many other scenarios due to the lack of towns.  As one beta tester put it, "The adventure requires a good deal of "wit", partly because of the lack of towns contributes to an overall scarceness of resources....  There was variety there that challenged the player.  Combine this with the resource scarcity and they require a good deal of wit and perseverance...."For those of you concerned that the entire scenario will be hacking and wandering due to the lack of towns, not to worry.  While there may be no human habitation about, other creatures are intelligent, and there are a bunch of folks to talk to and hundreds of dialog nodes.  After all, what would a scenario of mine be without odd folks about.    (If you don't know what I mean, play "Trouble in Mendor" or "Slavers of Paradise Valley.")This is a scenario designed for a medium level party, preferably one at the low end of the medium scale.  To try to select what type of party to bring, total party level should likely not exceed 60, the party should have some or most 4th level but not many 5th level spells, and no 6th or 7th level spells.  Your particular adventuring style may modify this a bit.  As a guide, you should be able to easily survive the first battle you encounter, but you should not finish it unscathed or undamaged.  By the time such a party finishes the scenario they will be upper-medium or lower-high level (close to a total of 100), depending on what parts of the scenario are explored.  As well, you have the potential to accumulate all the 4th and 5th level spells as well as some 6th level spells and some alchemical recipes.I would like to thank everyone who has sent comments, especially my Beta testers for their suggestions (Ivan Godard, Theresa Yoder, and especially Scott Monsma).  No matter how many times you go over it yourself, something else always comes up and it takes good people to find the goofs.  All errors remain mine.  Feel free to send me comments at wendyben@mail.idt.net, but please include the word Blades in the subject so my wife doesn't have to hunt through stuff from strangers to find the notes from her family.  I hope you find all the little touches combine to make an enjoyable gaming experience.

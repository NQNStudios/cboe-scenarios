Gornan: The House of the Dragon
          A Simple vacation
By Frahhamn(2001)

HISTORY:
v. 1.0.1  Rough outline of scenario/towns/missions &
          Annifer graphic drawn.

v. 1.0.2  Some major bugs fixed, including a bug
          that wouldn't let you beat the scenario.

v. 1.0.3  Many small bugs fixed & custom graphics
          added for Draug & Magical Field.

v. 1.0.4  Computer Crash - remade several towns & added
          new dialog.

Difficulty:
High - This is because of bigger monsters, and
       so you can use a party from, say, A Mild
       Rebellion.

Rating:
PG - One or two objectionable words(for some people,
     that is.)


This scenario isn't very big, but I really like the story-line. It ended just
the way I wanted it to.


CREDITS:
Gornan was created by Frahhamn.
All custom graphics were drawn by Frahhamn(or warped) on
   Mircosoft Paintbrush(Huzzah! :P)

Q: I can't get out of the caves. The guards keep locking
    me in.
A: Finish exploring the catacombs and speak to Annifer.
    Accept what mission he gives you.

Q: I can't find the fire of draug.
A: It is north, in a passage. Head through the lava, then
    go west.

Q: I can't find all three pieces of Ogain's Staff.
A: The first is in the catacombs, the second is in
    Tipcon Forest, and the last is in the Dark Woods.



HINTS:

--- It's not a good idea to try to attack at the feast.
--- Don't try to kill Annifer. His breath is worse than his bite.
--- There is a small marketplace in Dragonshire(north)
    that can be very useful.

Thank you for downloading the best scenario ever, "Terror From The Park" by The Almighty Doer of Stuff!

It's intended for parties of any size and any level.

           |***************|
Here's the |***IMPORTANT***| info:
           |***************|

Here are the files in this folder:

 TERRPARK.EXS - The actual scenario. Put this in your BLADSCEN folder (or whatever folder holds the scenarios in your version of BoE).
 TERRPARK.sit - This contains three files: 
         terrpark.meg - the graphics file for Mac computers, which should be decompressed and placed in the same folder as TERRPARK.EXS

                                   |**************|
         TERRPARK.EXS - This is an |***OUTDATED***| version of this scenario which you SHOULD NOT USE!.
                                   |**************|

                        I can't open the SIT in Windows without corrupting the MEG graphics file, so I can't change the EXS inside it.
                        If you do for some reason want to use the old version (1.1.0), it will still work properly.
                        However, I say this is important because I changed the content rating from G to PG.
                        I don't want to be harrassed or sued by angry parents for traumatizing their kids with my graphic descriptions
                        of vomiting, grievous injury and death because they thought it was appropriate for young children.
           readme.txt - An older version of what you're reading. Ignore it.
 terrpark.bmp - The graphics file for Windows. Put it in the same folder as the scenario.
IMPORTANT.txt - What your are reading right now.


Have fun!

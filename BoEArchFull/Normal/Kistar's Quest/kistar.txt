Kistar's Quest- By Anna Stewart. Info on the game: I started this game in early August and finished on the 9th of October, 12:32 am. It took a loooong time. I hope that the scenario is enjoyable. It's supposed to be a follow-on from the Exile trilogy but there's no need to have played the previous games to understand it.

  Blades Of Exile:Monster scenerio.                   If you have any problems or questions e-mail me at BlackArow@aol.com  This scenerio that I made has a long and exciting plot.  Be prepared for strong enemies, and half-puzzles for you and your party to navigate through.  Unlike many other scenerios that people make and put very hard on it and it is actually easy, this scenerio is hard and I am not lying about it either.  If you do not believe me just play the game.  Be free to e-mail me if you need to because you get stuck somewhere or if you find something wrong with the scenerio.  This took me to a year to makeand I would appreciate it if you like it, to e-mail me and tell me what you thought about it.											Thanks.											 	Jeremy Yakavonis

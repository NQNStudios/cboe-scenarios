Green Meadows (Readme)
  v1.1.0

Game Level: Medium to high Level Parties.

You've come to the remote Empire region of Green Meadows in response
to a plea for help.  Can you suceed in driving out the evil being who's
terrorizing the region or will you fail?  Fame and fortune can be yours
if you don't fail...

Note: Green Meadows is rated R due to some adult situations.

This is my second effort at creating a scenario for public consumption.
I've worked hard at tuning the monsters a little better to give a higher
level party a run for their money (I hope).  I've borrowed several towns
and situations (the Arena, for example) from some of my other (private)
scenarios (those not really ready for prime-time) and I hope I've caught 
all of the references to those other adventures (if not, let me know).

Also, I've included a town called 'Seers' just north of Navarone (the 
starting town).  This town is my attempt at making a 'on-line' help/hint
area for players.  Hopefully in it will be answers to any questions 
players may have.

Changes:
--------
2000-09-29 (1.1.0) - Fixed the problem with custom item graphics when displayed
                     in a shop window (finally read through the tech notes on
                     the Spiderweb site.  Also up the cost of items for sale
                     to make the game a little more high level.
2000-08-01 (1.0.1) - Fixed some conversation elements.  Added more outdoor
                     encounters/events.  Clean up some other minor points.

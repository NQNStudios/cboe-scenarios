If I forgot anyone, I apologize.  A hard disk accident wiped out
most of the image information I had.

Several images are also reworked (ie., slightly modified)
images from the stock BOE monsters and others.

Changes:
--------
2000-07-21 (1.0.3) - Changed some of the conversation elements and fixed some
 spelling on others (thanks to Billy Harris <wharris@mail.airmail.net>).
2000-05-07 (1.0.2) - Changed the entrance coding to Goldtooth McGraw's Cave.
 Modified several of the pirate monsters level/armor/skill to make the game
 a little higher level.  Added stuff done flags to the unique creatures so that 
 they will stay dead after killing them.  Most of these changes thanks to
 feedback received from Andrew Barton.
2000-04-29 (1.0.1) - Changed scenario icon, added outdoor map (gif) to zip file.
2000-04-20 (1.0.0) - Finished, released to public.

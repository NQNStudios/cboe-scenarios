Promise Island - Goldtooth McGraw's Cave Lever Puzzle Hint/Solution.

Most of the scenario should be fairly easy to figure out (I personally don't
like playing games that make it too difficult).  The one place that may catch
you is getting into Goldtooth McGraw's cave (see hint below).

The lever puzzle used to get into the cave is a binary number.  You are told
what number you need by the sign by the gate.  By inspecting the signs on the 
wall behind the levers, you will see that the lowest lever represents the
least significant bit (bit 0) up the the upper lever lever which represents
the most significant bit (bit 7).  When you pull a lever, it toggles the bit
it represents to one or back to zero.  The levers all start in the zero
position.  By stepping out of the cave, then back in, the levers are reset 
back to the zero position (solution below).

The binary representation of 221 is (starting with most significant):
 "11011101"
So to open the gate, you need to (starting from the bottom lever up and in the
zero position): pull, skip, pull, pull, pull, skip, pull, pull.

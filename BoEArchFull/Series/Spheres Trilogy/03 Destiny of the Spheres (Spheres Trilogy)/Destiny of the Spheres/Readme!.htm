The gate was activated by musicitself. You could be singing or even be just thinking about a song, andwhen the gate passed over you, you were transported to another place. Manymusicians disappeared from the Empire through this gate.<p>After Empire mages discovered the gate, they spent 50 years tracking,stabilizing, and eventually controlling it. When the first bold adventurersstepped through the now-stable portal, they were astounded.<p>The land consisted of a large number of islands floating in the ether!Some islands had formed chains - they were more or less bound togetherby tough, thick vines, making travel between some isles possible. Descendentsof the people who had traveled there over the years had formed loose communitiesand even had built some small cities. The most amazing discovery of all,however, was the Music of the Spheres.<p>These seven intelligent orbs existed in a large clearing on the islandwhere the portal opened into the "Realm of the Spheres," as this placebecame known. Over time, many mages and musicians alike traveled to theRealm to see the Spheres.<p>Recently, the Spheres and the Realm came under attack by mysteriousbeings known as the D'kar. The original inhabitants of the Realm, theywere thought destroyed long ago as a result of their own foul experiments.<p>Soon after the D'kar vanished the Spheres had entered the Realm, andturned it into the wondrous place it now is. The D'kar were not destroyed,but merely banished, and are now attempting to return and subjugate theRealm.<p>They nearly succeeded in their first attempt - a magical abduction ofthe Spheres. The Spheres fought back and were instead scattered throughoutthe Realm, helpless but alive.<p>Thanks to you, the Spheres were recovered and the D'kar plot was revealed.The Spheres barred D'kar access to the Realm, but realized the malevolentD'kar would never stop until they reclaimed the Realm.<p>Thus, an alliance between the Realm and the Empire was forged. The Empire,wishing to defend its own borders, agreed to supply troops in defense ofthe Realm. The Spheres, having an unmatched knowledge of the Realm, providedthe guidance needed for a successful campaign.<p>At the request of the Spheres, you returned to the Realm shortly afteryour first adventure ended there and proceeded to perform a series of questsfor the Empire and the Spheres. Your main accomplishment was the recoveryof the Instruments of Tonality, instruments the Spheres hoped to use asweapons against the D'kar. The instruments were activated, with devastatingresults. A huge portal to the D'kar's realm was opened, and the D'kar camepouring through it. At the same time you were pushed through the portalto the D'kar's realm by the Master, a formerly-crazed mage that knew agreat deal about the D'kar. As you helped heal the Master, curing him ofhis madness, this action seemed strange to you. But you believe the Mastermust have a reason for doing so.<p>Now you are trapped in the realm of the D'kar, a dark, strange place.Surviving will be difficult. Destroying the D'kar, improbable. Findinga way home? Impossible. Thus begins the "Destiny of the Spheres," the thirdand final installment in the "Spheres" triology.<p><hr ALIGN=left><p><b>The Adventure</b><p>This non-linear adventure contains three major quests, numerous minoradventures, and dozens of special encounters.

Parties that don't match this description will find "Destiny" toohard or too easy.<p>Use the included Destiny Party Maker (thanks, Tarl Kudrick!) to constructa party that meets this suggestion, if you don't already have one. Thenrun the "Destiny" scenario. Please note the Destiny Party Maker may notgive you exactly what you need in terms of experience and levels, especiallyif you are playing a party with a great deal of advantageous traits, ora party with fewer than six players. Use your own judgement, and perhapsthe BoE Character Editor, if you feel your party is not balanced correctlyfor this scenario.<p>In the Destiny Party Maker are several weapons one normally would haveacquired in "Quests of the Spheres." They are not essential to the scenario,and may be taken or left; it's up to you.<p><hr ALIGN=left><p><b>Stuck?</b><p><a href="http://www.clat.psu.edu/homes/bxb11/boe/doshelp.htm">Checkout the on-line help file.</a> Or, look at the help file that came withthe scenario - they are the same. You didn't delete it, did you?<p><b>Please Consider...</b><p>If you like this game, please consider making a small donation to yourlocal literacy council. Even five dollars goes a long way with these organizations.They are underfunded, rely on volunteers, and fulfill an important needin our society.<p><hr ALIGN=left><p><b>The Future</b><p>Who knows? I may create some small adventures, if the BoE Scenario isever updated. Frankly, this is a lot of work for no renumeration.

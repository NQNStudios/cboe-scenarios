Version 1.0
by Terror's Martyr

=================================================================
Once again, after ten years, you return to Birmington.  This prosperous, resource-filled vale brings back memories...  It was here where you came, after recieving a faded ad, ten years ago.  You still keep the old parchment as a souvenier.  You were told to see Mayor Pinochet, as to recieve a mission for 1,000 gold.  You took the ad with you, and set out for this tiny little city.  After a few days of journeying, you made it into this small, quaint little town.  You walked into the now-ruined building to the northwest, which was at one point the home of Mayor Pinochet.  He gave you a mission to slay some bandits, which turned out to be quite a quest...

FILES INCLUDED:
* bandits2.bmp
This is the graphics file for PC users.  Place it in the "BLADSCEN" folder.
* bandits2.exs
This is the scenario itself.  Place it in the "BLADSCEN" folder for PC users or the "Blades of Exile Scenarios" folder for Macs.
* bandits2.gif
This is the graphics file for PC users in case bandits2.bmp does not work.  When you use it, however, you must first convert it into bitmap format.  Most graphic editors such as Photoshop or MSPaint can do that.  Place it in the same folder as bandits2.exs
* bandits2.meg.sit
This is the graphics file for Mac users.  Use Stuffit to unstuff this file, and place the .meg file that is unstuffed into the same folder as bandits2.exs
* bandits2README.txt
This is the file you are reading right now.
* bandits2Walkthrough.doc
This is the walkthrough.  It can be opened by most versions of Microsoft Word.  (I opted not to use Adobe Pagemaker because while it is better, it's used by less people.  If you can't open the Word file, just email me and I'll send you a txt file.)

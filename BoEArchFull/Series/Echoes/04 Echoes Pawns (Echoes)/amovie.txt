Echoes: Pawns is a "movie" scenario.  What does that mean?  It means that there is no combat or interaction (well, some), and it shows the party a series of events that are beyond their control.  Any level party may play.  This scenario is rated PG, for minimally gory descriptions.

I would like to thank my (semi-) betatester, Imban.  I guess a movie doesn't need any testing, but considering he has tested every single other Echoes scenario, I planned to not make this an exception. ;)

I would like to thank the graphics of whos graphics I used:

So you beat it?  There are two points where Katothen asks you a question. Answer differently, and you might see something different.  Each has interesting information.

I'd apprectiate any constructive criticism, bug reports, or reccomentations you might have.  Email me at <terrorsmartyr@wi.rr.com>.
Thanks for playing!

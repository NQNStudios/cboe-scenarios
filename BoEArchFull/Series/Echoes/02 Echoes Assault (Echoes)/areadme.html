Due to the unique action-based nature or <u>Echoes: Assault</u>, similar to <u>An Apology</u> in a few respects, the scenario is based more around going through tight situations and you are pretty much held by the hand as you go through.  The parts you might need help on, however, are listed below:
<br><br>
<li>When defending Earthford, take out the cannons, dragons, and Passive Illithids.  In the first wave, the rest will retreat after you take out the cannons and Passive Illithid.
<li>Never forget your special spells!  There are many places where you lose, die, or are stuck for a while when you don't cast your spells.  Most of them are necessary throughout the game, one of them can make things easier in a boss battle when used.
<li>This scenario can be finished, but it can also be won.  Both are difficult, and in fact finishing might be more difficult in some aspects, but search each area you encounter carefully, especially when there doesn't seem to be any pressing force making you go places.
<li>Search around for treasure.  In many places, there is a spellbook or two, or perhaps some potions.  All are quite valuable, considering the difficulty of this scenario.
</ul><br>
On a final note, I wish you the best of luck.  It'll be needed.

This scenario has a Hall of Fame, which you can find here:
<h4 align=center><a href="http://www.geocities.com/terrorsmartyr/scenarios/assaulthof.html">Echoes: Asaault Hall fo Fame</a></h4>
To be placed in the hall of fame, email me at <a href="mailto:terrorsmartyr@wi.rr.com">terrorsmartyr@wi.rr.com</a>, and describe with fair detail how you won.  Remember, this scenario can be <u>won</u>, or it can be just <u>finished</u>.  Winning takes much more effort, and you will be told when you have won.  Good luck getting into the hall of fame!  Any number of entries will be accepted.

I would feel I was cheating some important people if I didn't list them here, so here are the people who made this scenario possible:<br><br>
My beta-testers, who found heaps of errors in the many parts of the scenario I wrote in 2AM:
<ul>
<li>The Talking Spider, aka Morgan Wild, who gave many comments about the game.
<li>Imban, who despite being too lazy to make a prefab party, offered valuable help in creature balancing (however <u>ungodly late</u> his reports were).
<li>Brett Bixler, who gave many suggestions and helped this scenario immensely.
<li>Glynn Reaper, who while not a tester, made the prefab PC party for General Boston.
<li>LightningExiled, who unfortunately could not test due to a major hard drive error or something of the like, but I guess I'll put her up here anyway.
<li>Iambobsushi, who was a valuable aid in betatesting, however odd some of his comments were. :P
<li>Desperance, for providing ample inner jokes to insert into the scenario.
<li>You, for playing.  I hope you enjoy this, and send sincere feedback.
</ul><br>

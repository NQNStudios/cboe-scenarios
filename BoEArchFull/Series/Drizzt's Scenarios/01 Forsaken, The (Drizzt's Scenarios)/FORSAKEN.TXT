Both of these are excellent Blades pages, probably the two best.

Graphics freely borrowed from:

Tim Farland - Animated Fireplace, Nocturn (purple drake), Pyrog (red bad guy),
	      and Townswoman graphic	

Tim has (I think) the best original BoE artwork I've seen.  Check his website at

Draxis - Dark Warrior, The Lorax, Skeleton (Glauri)
I made some very minor modifications to Draxis' Dracolich to create the Lorax, and
shrunk it to make the smaller version.

Gil-Glorion - Sword Rack, Archer's Target
Jon Richards - Surface Waterfall
Paul Henderson - Grey Tower, Dark Mage

Many thanks for their talent, which is much greater than mine.  All other graphics
were modified by me from existing BoE graphics or public domain pictures.

Forsaken trainer modified from the High Level Party Maker by Tarl Roger Kudrick.


The Forsaken is a Blades Of Exile scenario which attempts to be faithful to the
world of Exile, but also tries to tell a new story.  This scenario is designed for 
medium level parties, but is rated at very high to avoid the HP doubling thing.
Use the trainer that is included if you don't have an appropriate party, but an
experienced Exile player should be able to win with a new party.  

Most of what you have to do should be fairly obvious, but if you get stuck, 
here are some hints:

Things generally happen in a linear fashion, so complete the mission you were
sent on!  There are usually pretty clear suggestions on what you need to do next.  
There are a few side quests that have nothing to do with the main story, so if it 
doesn't fit directly into the plot, it doesn't need to be completed.

There is no real time limit, so slow down and enjoy the scenery.  Some things will 
change in the beginning, depending on how fast you do the first few quests, but no 
matter what happens the game can completed.

There is a great deal of conversation in this scenario, some of it quite important 
to your missions.  I have tried to make the appropriate player response as obvious
and logical as possible, usually by keying on the last or one of the last long words.
This is not always the case, however, and some NPCs respond to words in the middle
of their dialogue.  A few NPCs even respond to words other than those in their 
dialogue, although these are never necessary to complete the scenario.  Hints to 
these responses are found somewhere else.

You'll quickly find The Spine is a nasty place.  I wouldn't suggest going in there
unless you have a reason to, or have something to help you through.

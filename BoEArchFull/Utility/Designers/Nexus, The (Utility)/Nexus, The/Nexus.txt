The Nexius is a testing land for adventurers.

Parties can enter the towers and see just how effective their defensive spells are against Affect Party - (Curse, Disease, Dumbfound, Poison, remove Invulnerability, Slow, etc.).

The Defensive spells - like Major Haste, Major Blessing, Protection, Restore Mind, Cure All, Bless Party, Avatar, etc - may be cumulative.  I know casting a lot of Bless Partys can make it last over 80 rounds and I'm sure there has to be maximum Blessing effect (for the to hit percentage, extra damage, and damage reduced from attacks).

The towers are self-explanatory.  The officials have information as well as the runes display a small message as you step on them.

Fighting monsters:
  The Tower of Combat is the only place with monsters.  The designer has to use the Scenario Editor to change the town encounter groups 1 (within the 4 runes) and 2 (usually near the middle of the tower).

  As these are One-time place town encounters, you need to reset the towns in any of the other towers by pressing ">" - this should allow repeated testing with the encounter group in the Tower of Combat.  Setting the flag to 0 doesn't work, this 250 thing truly makes it a one-time thing.

  Ideal use of this part of The Nexus:

    Use the Scenario Editor to change the monsters (type, number, placement)
    Talk to the official to set up the encounters (group 1, group 2, eliminate all monsters, or play on the runes)
    Step on the runes and observe the effects
    Use time and Defensive spells to remove the effects

    If you want, use the portals to stairway to the Tower of Combat and attack the desired group of monsters


Designing Affect Party special spells
  A designer can take a typical party that would be in the scenario through the towers and see what Affect Party special spells would do - for example, a Curse 7 and Slow 3 before the party fights 7 Vahnatai (encounter group 2).

  Of course, since these spells are considered Mage or Priest level 8 or higher, they would be used by only the very high level hostile spell casters (Erika, Rentar-Ihrno, Order mages, Dragons, etc.)


The Crater of Sounds is self-explanatory, talk to Echoer.

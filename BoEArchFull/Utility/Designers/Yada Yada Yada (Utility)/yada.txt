Mac Users!  You will need to create a MEG file for this
scenario.  However, the graphics in it are irrelevant (so
long as they're 40 rows or less).  Just make a copy of
the "Valley of the Dying Things" meg, and rename it
yada.meg.

"The Debug Check"

The principal things to remember for the Debug Check are:

1. Make sure you place the two creatures somewhere the party 
(or quickfire the party unleashes) can get to.  The best place
is a single, enclosed room.
2. Make sure that either one monster is always guaranteed to lose
the fight, or that both monsters have the same life flag.
3. Make sure the monsters are set to types that will fight each
other.
4. Make sure the monsters can see each other.  In dark areas,
include a light source near them.
5. Finally, make sure the party cannot progress without the
key stuff done flag being set to 1.

Obviously, customization of "The Debug Check" is entirely up
to you.  You can attempt to integrate it into the scenario proper
(See generally "An Apology") or just leave it lying out there
with no justification whatsoever ("Falling Stars").


"The Shadow Effect"

Things to keep in mind here:
1. It works best on PCs.  MAC users see a bunch of funky colors.
2. It needs a graphics file to operate.
3. You can play around with terrain, but I've found that often
becomes nothing more than headache.  Still, if you can find a
good use, go for it!


"The Way Out"
Things to keep in mind here:
1. Make sure the party either (A) starts with "The Way Out" or
(B) gains possession of it very early on.
2. Make sure you've checked the "Special Item Can Be Used" box.

The coding for the way out:
(Where the special item calls scenario special node #1)
1. Display Dialogue, "Are you sure you want to quit the scenario?"
Yes/No Options.  If yes, go to 2.  If no, do nothing.
2. End Scenario.

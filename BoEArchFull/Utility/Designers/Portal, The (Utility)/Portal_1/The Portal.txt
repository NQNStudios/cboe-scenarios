THE PORTAL by Bain-Ihrno

 Thank you for taking a look at my Portal utility. Here's
how it works. You will need to indicate this in your
scenario if you use it.

 There are two panels. The first panel has two options,
the second has 5. Different settings cause the portal
to take you to different places. There are 10 destinations
you can go to. I put in random scenes in the utility
so you can try the portal out. Here is a list:

0,0 = Town 1
0,1 = Town 2
0,2 = Town 3
0,3 = Town 4
0,4 = Town 5
1,0 = Town 6
1,1 = Town 7
1,2 = Town 8
1,3 = Town 9
1,4 = Town 10

------------------------

In your scenario, it will actually take you to the towns,
not just scenes, of course!

You are allowed to make any additions/changes to the utility
if you decide to use it. For example, you can build a
town around the portal. You can change the grass to cave floor!
You can even make it so the party can't enter the control
room without paying/completing a quest/etc!

If you're making a larger scenario, and you're skilled
with the editor too, you are more than welcome to add
more destinations on your own.

Of course, please give me credit if you use the portal.
Thank you. 

Enjoy the utility, and check out all the towns!

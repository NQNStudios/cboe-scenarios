Lvl = Level of monster     Calc = Calculated level     Skill = Skill     Arm = Armor     Hlth = Health
AT = Number of melee attacks
     D1-3 = Number of dice of damage for attacks #1-3     S1-3 = Sides on dice of damage for attacks #1-3
     (so if D1=2 and S1=8, it's 2d8, or 1-8 twice, added together)
PL, ML = Level of Priest, Mage spells the monster can cast


ASTERISKS AND NOTES

* A Doomguard is technically a level 4 monster, because a monster's x.p. value is based on its level.
  A Doomguard splits up into many other Doomguards, so if this monster was given the level value it
  deserves, it would give way too many x.p. when a party slew "one" of them. For scenario design
  purposes, a Doomguard should be considered a level 30 monster, or possibly even higher.

** Multiple regression determined that if a Dragon's level was derived the same way other monsters'
  levels are (save the Doomguard), a Dragon would be a level 133 monster. And my regression didn't take
  breath weapons into account!

*** In the game, the Blood Beast is a level zero monster. That has to be an error on the game designer's
  part. Regression techniques determined that a Blood Beast should be a level 24 monster.

NOTES FOR THE STATISTICALLY INCLINED: I tried to find a theoretically sound set of variables to predict
a monster's level, but my theories weren't backed up by the data all that well. So, I performed a
stepwise regression, allowing the computer's algorithms to choose what order the regressors should be
entered into the regression equation.  There are all kinds of reasons why such "automatic" regression
strategies are inferior to theoretically based ones, but they didn't seem to matter much here.
However, by examining the results, I did hypothesize (and then find) one interesting point. There's an
interaction between the maximum amount of damage a monster can do in one round with its regular attack
forms, and what level of mage spell it can use.  This interaction is statistically significant at the
.001 level even when the other significant variables are entered.

All in all, the following variables account for 85% of the variance in a monster's level (that is, the
adjusted R-square is .85):

Health, armor, level of mage spells, skill, maximum possible damage, and the interaction between mage
spell and maximum possible damage.  Health, by itself, accounts for 72% of the variance in monsters'
levels.  (Dragon, Doomguard, and Blood Beast data was left out of the calculations.  Also, the first
7 Townspeople were removed, since all 8 are identical and I didn't want that skewing the results.)

A monster's ability to cast priest spells has no significant effect on it's level, even with all the
above variables accounted for (p>.17). 

I did not enter a monster's special abilities (poison, disease, breath weapon, etc.) into the level
calculations.  Things like that probably contribute greatly to the remaining 15% of variance, but there
are so many special abilities of unequal strength that finding a good way to represent them was too
annoying a task to bother with.


CUSTOM MONSTERS

Want to make your own monsters?  Great.  Here's the easiest way to decide what level your monster should
be, while keeping it reasonably consistent with Jeff Vogel's current system. 

LEVEL = HEALTH divided by 10, then add a level or two for special powers like causing poison, etc, and
one level for every level of wizard spell the monster can cast. 

But if you want to be more accurate, try this:

LEVEL = 0.081 * HEALTH + 0.204* SKILL + 0.261 * ARMOR + Mage level, then add a level or two for special
powers.  (Priest spells don't affect level, believe it or not, although they probably should.)

Or you can do what Jeff presumably did, and just play around with the numbers until the game balance is
right.  The above are just two estimates of what Blades of Exile's game balance is already set at, with
the second estimate being more reliable than the first.  An even more reliable estimate would take six
variables into account and require a bunch of extra math on your part on top of that, since two of those
six variables are "composite" variables: special combinations of variables that already exist in the game.
Not a big deal if you've got software to run complex statistical analyses, but a very big deal otherwise.

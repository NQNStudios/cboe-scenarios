Thank you for downloading my replication project! This scenario is a hopefully complete terrain replication of all the 'Exile II, Chapter 1' towns and dungeons in a Blades of Exile format, so that you can use these towns in a BoE scenario setting. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST A TERRAIN REPLICATION! THERE ARE NO MONSTERS AND HARDLY ANY SPECIALS IN THIS SCENARIO! 
This scenario should not be opened in Blades of Exile, because your party will not be able to go anywhere. There is virtually nothing in the outdoors section (to be replicated later). Use the Scenario Editor! If you do decide to use these towns in a scenario, please let me know via e-mail (darobinbot@netscape.net). If you notice anything I might have missed during the replication process, please tell me, again, via e-mail. 
Anyway, that's about it. I hope you can put these to good use!

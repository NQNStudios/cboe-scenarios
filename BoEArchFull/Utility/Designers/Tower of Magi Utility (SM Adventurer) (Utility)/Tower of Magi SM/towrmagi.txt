Tower of Magi Scenario Utility v1.01:
---------------------------------------

By S.M Adventurer

This is my Tower of Magi. Feel free to use it in your scenario, but do not erase the 
name credit sign in the hallway near the enterance. 

The scenario is unpassworded, so feel free to modify it as you please.

The Tower contains personality nodes and Stuff Done Flags, so you will need to modify 
those if you choose to use this Tower of Magi in your scenario. 

Anyway, I hope you will find this utility useful.

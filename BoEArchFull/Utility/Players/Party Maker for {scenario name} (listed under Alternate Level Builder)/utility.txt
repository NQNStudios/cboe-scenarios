Alternate Party Maker
by Ryan Thompson

This party builder was meant to be an alternative to Tarl Kudrick's party builder, as it goes more in detail and requires the party to complete a short combat section. This is to assure that the party is ready to go into your scenario. There is no password, just don't edit out the part of the intro text that gives me credit.

Instructions to designers:
¥All places in the party maker where dialog boxes say {scenario name}, you should fill in your scenario name.
¥Change the name of utility.exs to something that connects with your scenario. For example: If your scenario is lostguys.exs, this file should be something like lostgupm.exs.
¥Change the scenario's graphic to match the one that you gave your scenario. If your scenario uses the graphic with the sword in the rock, this one should too.
¥In the scenario Read-Me file, warn the party that gold is easily wasted.

The scenario was beta-tested by Olivier Monnin and Janet Cone.

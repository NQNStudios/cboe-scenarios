and make them more readily accessible so they can continue to be enjoyed for free.
**4. Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work:** these scenarios were created to be shared freely. Archiving them only serves to increase designers'
reach.

please contact nqn AT fastmail DOT com. I will remove your scenario(s) and erase them from
the repository's history.
